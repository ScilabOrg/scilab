GUI Refactoring and Improvements
================================

* New uicontrols styles:
 - tab: component which enables the user to switch between sets of uicontrols by
        clicking on a tab.
        The children components are "frame" uicontrols.
        Two dedicated properties have been added to configure this component:
         - title_position: Position of the tabs
         - title_scroll: Indicates if tabs must all be displayed at a time or
                         managed with scroll features.
 - layer: Component which enables the user to make parts of a GUI visible/invisible
          programmatically.
 - spinner: Component which enables the user to select/edit a value between bounds
            with a fixed step.

* New uicontrols properties:
 - border: Used to set some decoration properties on "frame" uicontrols.
            These decorations can be created and initialized with the createBorder
            and the createBorderFont functions.
 - scrollable: Used to add scrolling capabilities on "frame" uicontrols.
 - groupname: Used to group "radiobutton" and "checkbox" uicontrols for an easier
              management.
 - icon: Add an icon to "pushbutton", "text" and "frame" uicontrols.
 - margin: Empty space around uicontrols.

* New uimenu properties:
 - icon: add an icon on the left of the menu label.

* "listbox" and "popupmenu" style uicontrols can now manage colors selection, icons, background
  and foreground colors when the "String" property is set to a matrix matching the format:
  ["#color1", "Item1", "#background1", "#foreground1"; "#color2", "Item2", ..., ...]
  ["icon1", "Item1", "#background1", "#foreground1"; "icon2", "Item2", ..., ...]
  with "#color1", "#background1" and "#foreground1" in HTML format #XXXXXX.
  Then the component will display a colored box or icon on the left of the associated string,
  and different background/foreground colors for items.

* New management of uicontrols positioning:
  In previous versions, uicontrols position was managed in an absolute way through
  their "Position" property and the "Resizefcn" property of their parent figure.
  Using the new layout management in figures and "frame" style uicontrols, position
  is now managed in an automatic way based on Java layouts.
  New dedicated properties have been added in figure and uicontrols:
   - layout: layout type.
   - layout_options: configuration of the layout.
                     Options can be initialized with the createLayoutOptions function.
  Type "help layouts" in Scilab for more information about available types and options.
  Uicontrols position is then managed through the "constraints" property.
  A new createConstraints function has been added to managed these contraints.

* New figures properties:
 - icon: Allows to customize the figure icon.
 - menubar: allows to create windows without any menu bar (default menus will not be created).
 - menubar_visible: Manages menu bar visibility.
 - toolbar: Allows to create windows without any toolbar.
 - toolbar_visible: Manages toolbar visibility.
 - infobar_visible: Manages infobar visibility.
 - resize: Allows to lock window size.
 - dockable: Allows to create dockable/standard figures.
 - default_axes: Allows to manage default axes creation in figures.

* The figure "visible" property management has evolved and offers new possibilities:
 - When the figure is docked, this property manages the visibility
   of components inside the figure (uicontrols, axes, ...).
   In previous releases, this same property setting only managed axes.
 - When the figure is not docked, this property manages the visibility
   of the whole figure including its decorations.

* New way to create GUI using XML files:
 - Created GUI using the figure/uicontrol/uimenu functions can now be saved in
   this new format using saveGui function.
 - XML files in this format can be loaded in Scilab using the loadGui function.
   This function aims at creating GUI in a more efficient way.

* New rendering for GUI/uicontrols:
  In this version, uicontrols use the defaults of the OS Look & Feel.
  Some properties default values are not set by Scilab and then can be different from an
  OS to another.
  To come back to the previous and deprecated behavior, you can use the related
  property on the "Console" handle:
  set(get(0), "UseDeprecatedSkin", "on");
  Note that this deprecated behavior will be removed in future versions.

* New way to access uicontrols using a path containing their "Tag" and their parent(s) "Tag" property.
  See the set and get functions help page for more details.

* New display for uicontrols handles properties. Only properties used for Java rendering are displayed.
  To display all available properties, use the "ShowHiddenProperties" "Console" property.


Graphics Evolutions
===================

* clf function now also works with "frame" uicontrols.

* New axes properties:
 - ticks_format: Format of the ticks labels.
 - ticks_st: Scales and translates factors applied to ticks position when formatting
             the ticks labels.
 - auto_margins: Activated by default, this property lets Scilab compute margins
                 needed to display axes decorations (titles, labels, ...).

                     displayed in all the datatips of this polyline.
                     This function can be overloaded by setting a display
                     function on each datatip handle.
 - display_function_data: Additional data needed for datatips display function.
 - datatips: Handles of the datatips of the polyline.

                 Changes between version 5.5.0-beta-1 and 5.5.0
                 ==============================================

GUI Refactoring and Improvements
================================

* New uicontrols styles:
 - tab: component which enables the user to switch between sets of uicontrols by
        clicking on a tab.
        The children components are "frame" uicontrols.
        Two dedicated properties have been added to configure this component:
         - title_position: Position of the tabs
         - title_scroll: Indicates if tabs must all be displayed at a time or
                         managed with scroll features.
 - layer: Component which enables the user to make parts of a GUI visible/invisible
          programmatically.
 - spinner: Component which enables the user to select/edit a value between bounds
            with a fixed step.

* New uicontrols properties:
 - border: Used to set some decoration properties on "frame" uicontrols.
            These decorations can be created and initialized with the createBorder
            and the createBorderFont functions.
 - scrollable: Used to add scrolling capabilities on "frame" uicontrols.
 - groupname: Used to group "radiobutton" and "checkbox" uicontrols for an easier
              management.
 - icon: Add an icon to "pushbutton", "text" and "frame" uicontrols.
 - margin: Empty space around uicontrols.

* New uimenu properties:
 - icon: add an icon on the left of the menu label.

* "listbox" and "popupmenu" style uicontrols can now manage colors selection, icons, background
  and foreground colors when the "String" property is set to a matrix matching the format:
  ["#color1", "Item1", "#background1", "#foreground1"; "#color2", "Item2", ..., ...]
  ["icon1", "Item1", "#background1", "#foreground1"; "icon2", "Item2", ..., ...]
  with "#color1", "#background1" and "#foreground1" in HTML format #XXXXXX.
  Then the component will display a colored box or icon on the left of the associated string,
  and different background/foreground colors for items.

* New management of uicontrols positioning:
  In previous versions, uicontrols position was managed in an absolute way through
  their "Position" property and the "Resizefcn" property of their parent figure.
  Using the new layout management in figures and "frame" style uicontrols, position
  is now managed in an automatic way based on Java layouts.
  New dedicated properties have been added in figure and uicontrols:
   - layout: layout type.
   - layout_options: configuration of the layout.
                     Options can be initialized with the createLayoutOptions function.
  Type "help layouts" in Scilab for more information about available types and options.
  Uicontrols position is then managed through the "constraints" property.
  A new createConstraints function has been added to managed these contraints.

* New figures properties:
 - icon: Allows to customize the figure icon.
 - menubar: allows to create windows without any menu bar (default menus will not be created).
 - menubar_visible: Manages menu bar visibility.
 - toolbar: Allows to create windows without any toolbar.
 - toolbar_visible: Manages toolbar visibility.
 - infobar_visible: Manages infobar visibility.
 - resize: Allows to lock window size.
 - dockable: Allows to create dockable/standard figures.
 - default_axes: Allows to manage default axes creation in figures.

* The figure "visible" property management has evolved and offers new possibilities:
 - When the figure is docked, this property manages the visibility
   of components inside the figure (uicontrols, axes, ...).
   In previous releases, this same property setting only managed axes.
 - When the figure is not docked, this property manages the visibility
   of the whole figure including its decorations.

* New way to create GUI using XML files:
 - Created GUI using the figure/uicontrol/uimenu functions can now be saved in
   this new format using saveGui function.
 - XML files in this format can be loaded in Scilab using the loadGui function.
   This function aims at creating GUI in a more efficient way.

* New rendering for GUI/uicontrols:
  In this version, uicontrols use the defaults of the OS Look & Feel.
  Some properties default values are not set by Scilab and then can be different from an
  OS to another.
  To come back to the previous and deprecated behavior, you can use the related
  property on the "Console" handle:
  set(get(0), "UseDeprecatedSkin", "on");
  Note that this deprecated behavior will be removed in future versions.

* New way to access uicontrols using a path containing their "Tag" and their parent(s) "Tag" property.
  See the set and get functions help page for more details.

* New display for uicontrols handles properties. Only properties used for Java rendering are displayed.
  To display all available properties, use the "ShowHiddenProperties" "Console" property.


Graphics Evolutions
===================

* set function prototype has been modified to allow the user to set multiple
  properties at once: set(h, "Property1", Value1, "Property2", Value2, ...)

* newaxes function now allows to create axes in "frame" uicontrols.

* clf function now also works with "frame" uicontrols.

* New axes properties:
 - ticks_format: Format of the ticks labels.
 - ticks_st: Scales and translates factors applied to ticks position when formatting
             the ticks labels.
 - auto_margins: Activated by default, this property lets Scilab compute margins
                 needed to display axes decorations (titles, labels, ...).
 - grid_thickness: Thickness of the grid plotting.
 - grid_style: Style of the grid plotting.
 - label_font_style: Font style used to draw the labels.

* New legends properties:
 - line_width: Width of the drawn line.
 - mark_count: Number of the drawn marks.

* New polyline properties:
 - mark_offset: Offset before the first mark.
 - mark_stride: Step between consecutive marks.
 - display_function: Name of the function used to customize the information
                     displayed in all the datatips of this polyline.
                     This function can be overloaded by setting a display
                     function on each datatip handle.
 - display_function_data: Additional data needed for datatips display function.
 - datatips: Handles of the datatips of the polyline.

* New Matplot property added :
 - rect: specifies the rectangle where the Matplot will be drawn.

* Datatips properties have been renamed for better readability:
 - tip_data --> data
 - tip_box_mode --> box_mode
 - tip_label_mode --> label_mode
 - tip_orientation --> orientation
 - tip_3component --> z_component
 - tip_auto_orientation --> auto_orientation
 - tip_interp_mode --> interp_mode
 - tip_disp_function --> display_function
