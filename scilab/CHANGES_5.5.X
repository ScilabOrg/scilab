* Functions erf, erfc, erfcx and calerf support complex arguments.

* New Solver:
 - daskr - differential-algebraic system solver with rootfinding 'daskr', using
BDF methods with direct and preconditioned Krylov linear solvers, from ODEPACK.

* New functions introduced:
 - getURL - Download an URL (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP...)
 - splitURL - Split a URL (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP...)
