            =================================================

Installation

* Under Windows, MKL packages are now included in Scilab installer and no more
  downloaded while installing Scilab.


Compilation
===========

 * Scilab requires conforming C++11 compilers


File input/output
==================

* The use of I/O console is now allowed with functions: mget, mgetl, mgetstr, mput, mputl and mputstr.

* mclearerr now returns a flag indicating the file identifier validity.

* fileinfo can now take a row vector as input.


Removed functions (previously declared as obsolete)
====================================================

* maxfile function is now obsolete.

* intersci has been removed. Please use swig instead.

* numdiff removed. Please use numderivative instead.

* derivative removed. Please use numderivative instead.

* gstacksize removed.


Functions modified
===================

* impl   : Recall impl with the same parameters as in its previous stop is now available.
* ode    : y0 is restricted to a column vector.
* pppdiv : return a scalar of type 'constant' when the rank is 0.
* pdiv   : return a matrix of type 'constant' when all the rank are 0.

Syntax clarifications
=====================

* Declaration of a number on two lines is no longer allowed:
 1..
 2

* {"foo"} returns a cell not a string matrix.

Deprecated behavior
====================

* Syntax %i:10 is now deprecated.

    write("TMPDIR/test", ["test", "sample"; "sample", "test"])
    "-" + mgetl("TMPDIR/test") + "-"


Removed functions
==================

* derivative removed. Please use numderivative instead.

* curblockc removed. Please use curblock instead.
