        Welcome to Scilab 6
        ===================

This file details the changes between 6.0.0-beta-1, 6.0.0-alpha-2, 6.0.0-alpha-1, and the previous release, version 5.5.2.

For a high-level overview of the changes in this release, please consult the "What's new" page of the help, by simply typing "help" in Scilab console.




        Changes between version 6.0.0-alpha-2 and 6.0.0-beta-1
        ======================================================


New Features
============

Xcos - the graphical tool for dynamic systems modeling and simulation - is 
finally functional in this release. You can now graphically create, edit, and
simulate models. No changes are visible to the user, but the new Xcos uses the
re-written Scilab engine, and is now running in native code, which should
provide much better performance as well as support for much bigger models.

Xcos can load and run models created with earlier versions of Scilab. However,
there are a few known limitations to upgrade of schemas created with
earlier versions:
 * Some links may not be imported correctly. If links disappear when opening
   the schema, simply re-create them manually. Simulation will then work
   properly. Please report when this happens as bugs, if possible with the
   original schema attached (or please send it to us in private if you
   prefer): we could not verify all the cases where this could happen,
   thus we are **very** interested in these cases.
 * When saving, schemas created with earlier versions of Xcos will be
   automatically converted to the 6.0 format: they cannot be opened again
   in Scilab/Xcos 5.x.

Bug Fixes
=========

* Bug #13918 fixed - Unmanaged operations on hypermatrix did not call overload functions.

* Bug #13298 fixed - Static analysis bugs detected by PVS-Studio fixed.

* Bug #13986 fixed - setdefaultlanguage did not set value correctly in Windows registry.

* Bug #13990 fixed - Windows installer did not ship all localization files.

* Bug #14178 fixed - tcl/tk unavailability on MacOS is now documented.

* Bug #14041 fixed - genlib crash when the file is locked by another program.

* Bug #14181 fixed - Calling intg (or integrate) in a function that is being integrated failed.

* Bug #14251 fixed - `spec` leaked some memory.

* Bug #14253 fixed - Insertion in a struct contained in a list fixed.

* Bug #14257 fixed - English spelling in messages and in comments.

* Bug #14300 fixed - Crash when playing with structures.

* Bug #14313 fixed - Parser did not create a column separator after spaces and '...' at the end of lines

Dependencies
=============

* Apache xmlgraphics stack upgraded to the latest versions :
  - xmlgraphics-commons 2.0.1
  - Batik 1.8
  - FOP 2.0

        Changes between version 6.0.0-alpha-1 and 6.0.0-alpha-2
        =======================================================

New Features
============

* Scilab now includes a full-featured debugger, with ability to run Scilab scripts or functions step-by-step, to put (conditional) breakpoint, in particular break only when an exception is set. Run "help debug" for more information.

* A new profiler and coverage tool has been added.
  It replaces the "profile" function (which is still there but not working, and will be removed in the final release).
  It produces HTML report for the time spent (profile) on each line. Example of use:

     covStart(isempty) // instruments the "isempty" macro; instrumenting a whole library can be done with: covStart("elementary_functions")
     for i=1:1e5; isempty(i); end // execute some code - this will be profiled
     covWrite("html", "TMPDIR/coverage") // write the profiling/coverage report as "report.html" in the folder specified as second parameter
     covStop(); // stop the profiling

  A function to merge multiple profiler/coverage is provided too: covMerge([ list_of_files_to_merge], file_to_merge_to).
  The API will change before the release; the current API is mostly to get feedback from the community.

* A "lint"-like command, slint, has been added, for code static analysis: it detects unclear, risky or suspicious code.
  Usage: slint("<sci filename>"). It is not documented yet.

Other feature changes
=====================

* Valgrind error detection added to test_run (on Linux only)

* Addition or subtraction with an empty matrix now return an empty matrix.

* SSE2, Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 support is now mandatory to run Scilab on Linux i686.

* A call stack limit has been introduced. Default maximum depth is setup to 1000 and
  can be changed by new function recursionlimit or by preferences interface.

* The floating point exception mode (ieee) is now set to 2 by default: floating point exceptions now produce "Inf" or "Nan",
  and do not cause any error. The previous behavior can be recalled by simply calling: ieee(0)

API modification
================

* User-defined functions written in C (gateways) must now use the "pvApiCtx" name for their second parameter, for example:

     int sci_Levkov(char *fname, void* pvApiCtx)

 instead of any "unsigned long l". This is now requires for some macros, such as Rhs(), to work.
 (Although not strictly an API change, it may require gateway code to be modified).
