        <p>Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions. It has a high level programming language allowing access to advanced data structures, 2-D and 3-D graphical functions.</p>
        <p>A large number of functionalities is included in Scilab:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maths &amp; Simulation: For usual engineering and science applications including mathematical operations and data analysis.</li>
            <li>2-D &amp; 3-D Visualization: Graphics functions to visualize, annotate and export data and many ways to create and customize various types of plots and charts.</li>
            <li>Optimization: Algorithms to solve constrained and unconstrained continuous and discrete optimization problems.</li> 
            <li>Statistics: Tools to perform data analysis and modeling.</li>
            <li>Control System Design &amp; Analysis: Standard algorithms and tools for control system study.</li>
            <li>Signal Processing: Visualize, analyze and filter signals in time and frequency domains.</li>
