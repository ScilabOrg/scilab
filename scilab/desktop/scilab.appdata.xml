        <p>Scilab is free and open source software for numerical computation providing a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications. Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions. It has a high level programming language allowing access to advanced data structures, 2-D and 3-D graphical functions. A large number of functionalities is included in Scilab:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maths &amp; Simulation: For usual engineering and science applications</li>
            <li>2-D &amp; 3-D Visualization: Graphics functions to visualize, annotate and export data</li>
            <li>Optimization: Algorithms to solve constrained and unconstrained continuous and discrete problems</li>
            <li>Statistics: Tools to perform data analysis and modeling</li>
            <li>Control System Design &amp; Analysis: Standard algorithms and tools for control system study</li>
            <li>Signal Processing: Visualize, analyze and filter signals in time and frequency domains</li>
            <li>Application Development: Increase Scilab native functionalities and manage data exchanges</li>
            <li>Xcos - Hybrid dynamic systems modeler and simulator: Modeling physical systems, control systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thanks to its ability to interconnect with third-party technologies and applications, Scilab can also act as a unique platform to bring together codes written in different programming languages in a single, unified language, thus facilitating their distribution, their back-up and use.
