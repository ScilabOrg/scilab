Contributions from the Scilab team have been done on the flexdock project
to fix these issues.

                   The user had to click in the main window to gain focus.

* bug 3614 fixed - Sub-applications could not have their own icons. This
                   problem was causing some issues with the "Alt-Tab" features
                   under some operating systems.

* bug 4247 fixed - The command xclick didn't work correctly.

* bug 4423 fixed - It was not possible to navigate in Scilab's menu with arrow
                   keys.

                   happened when SciNotes was started from the console.

* bug 7369 fixed - fun2string  produced incorrect code for parenthesis
                   exponentiation expressions.

* bug 7625 fixed - Some selection issues were appearing from time to time when
                   Scilab was losing the focus.

* 'whos' function updated, variables sorted by name (case insensitive).
  If a variable is global, a * appears after his type name.
