improve the Scilab documentation. More updates will follow in the upcoming
versions of Scilab.

* Documentation of trigonometry functions moved in a dedicated documentation
  section.

* Documentation of profiling functions moved in a dedicated documentation
  section.

Javasci:
========

A new version of the Java => Scilab API called Javasci v2 is now included into
the Scilab distribution.
This version fixes most the issues and limitations of the previous version.
This API is automatically fully tested through unitary tests and code coverage.
Please, note that previous version of Javasci remains available and shipped
into the Scilab distribution.
Advanced documentation and examples will be provided in the stable release of
Scilab 5.3.0.


License:
========

The license of all demos and examples have been changed to the 3-clause BSD
license. The domain public license was not valid in some countries.

  uimenus are no more (un)checked on mouse click. Moreover, they can now have
  a callback.

Graphic export:
===============

* Decrease the amount of feedbacks when exporting a graphic.


Graphics:
=========

Thanks to Samuel Gougeon, many improvements on the polarplot function:
* Clipping was missing. See bug #7007.
* In some common cases, values of radial labels were wrong with respect to the
plotted radial frame or/and were lacking of digits.
* When the plot was centered around an angle far from 45°, the radial labels
were completely clipped.
* Sampling of the angular frame is improved according to the number of drawn
quadrants.
* Improved H&V positionning of angular labels
* Polar frame drawn in grey instead of black for a better data visibility.
* if the basic radius is >= 10^4 or <=10^-4, LaTeX is used to display smart
$..10^p$ exponents instead of the D+/-## console style display.
* Finally, their positioning is still improved in order to avoid their mutual
overlaying for big values.

* bug 7110 fixed - When inserting a structure in a handle, the handle was
  overwritten.

* bug 7492 fixed - If its "data_mapping" property was set to "direct", the
  Grayplot object's data seemed to be transposed when displayed.

                   generated a zero divide error.

                   managed by ATOMS. The cause of the issue is the behaviour of

Incompatibilities:
==================

* The bug 4583 fix makes the default element value in string array assignment
  be an empty string instead of " ".


FFTW:
=====

* On Windows, Scilab can use FFTW3 wrapper of Intel Math Kernel Library.
  Select "Download FFTW3 wrapper optimized by Intel Math Kernel Library" during
  installation.


API_Scilab:
===========

* Error(x) is now deprecated and will be removed in Scilab 5.4.
  Please use SciError(x) instead.


Source reorganization:
======================

* 'tbx_builder_src', 'tbx_build_macros', 'tbx_builder_gateway', ... functions
   has been moved in modules_manager module.


Compilation:
============

* On Windows, Pentium III class (or equivalent) with SSE instructions is
  required.

* Scilab_f2c.sln can be exported to VS 2010 format.

* Windows 2000 operating system is no more supported.

* Scilab Mac OS X distribution only relies on Java 1.6 and is therefore now
  only available under 64-bit OS (Most of 10.5 and all 10.6 Mac OS X versions)

* Under Mac OS X, uses /usr/libexec/java_home instead of hardcoded paths to
  retrieve JAVA_HOME

* special_functions module is dynamically loaded by Scilab.

* tclsci module is dynamically loaded by Scilab.

* pvm module is dynamically loaded by Scilab.

* Many warnings detected by Intel Fortran 11.1.051 and more on Windows fixed.

* Better detection system of the dependencies version.

* Add a check of the minimal installations of hdf5 (1.8.4), batik (1.7).

* /usr/share/*/lib added to the Java search path for OpenSuse.

* Option --enable-compilation-tests added to the configure. With this option,
  if TestNG has been found, tests will be launched at compilation time.

* Added /usr/lib to JNI search path. Gluegen-rt needed it on openSUSE.

* bug 4300 fixed - Moving Command Queue management to core.

* bug 6432 fixed - Checkstyle disabled on SWIG (Java/JNI) generated files.

* bug 6643 fixed - --without-gui failed to disable Ocaml build (A Xcos
                   dependency).

Help Tools:
==========

* %helps_modules (global variable in Scilab) is only defined when
  Scilab build help and no more at Scilab's startup.


Core:
=====

* Under GNU/Linux, Unix and Mac OS X, for security purposes, temporary
  directory name is now randomized and permissions are limited to the user
  (See bug #3493).

* Under GNU/Linux, Unix and Mac OS X, if TMPDIR is set, Scilab will respect it
  to store its temporary files (See bug #3493).

* Under non-Windows system, the name of the temporary directory has been changed
  from SD_* to SCI_TMP_* to match the current Windows behavior.

* bug 6986 fixed - edit('toto.sce') created a file toto.sce.sci containing
                   a function named toto.sce

Tests:
======
