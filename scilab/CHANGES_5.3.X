               =================================================


Performance:
============

* Faster access to primitive table (internal). This change improves the overall
  speed of Scilab.


FFTW:
=====

* On Windows, Scilab can use FFTW3 wrapper of Intel Math Kernel Library.
  Select "Download FFTW3 wrapper optimized by Intel Math Kernel Library" during
  installation.

Graphics:
=========

* the set and get functions are now overloadable.

* bug 5284 fixed - In some case function "legend" drew line segments in its box
                   in a reverse order.

* bug 6835 fixed - Performing an interactive rotation after having executed the
                   "plot3d" function caused Scilab to freeze on 64-bit Windows.

* bug 6959 fixed - axis.tics_labels did not accept $..$ LaTeXed labels

API_Scilab:
===========

* Error(x) is now deprecated and will be removed in Scilab 5.4.

==============

* It is now possible to use LaTeX inline in the documentation. Thanks to 
  Calixte Denizet for this feature. (See bug #4329)

* bug 6630 fixed - JavaHelp does not update existing image files when 
                   building help.

                   attribute align="center" 

Optimization:
=============

* Simulated annealing: Added documentation for accept_func_default and 
  accept_func_vfsa.

Compilation:
============

* On Windows, Pentium III class (or equivalent) with SSE instructions is 
  required.

                   For Matlab compatibility, when this function is called with 
                   one input argument load(filename), it now looks for a binary 
                   file (if filename as no extension or .mat extension) or for an
                   ASCII file if filename has an other extension.

                   up-to-date (help overloading).
