  section.

This API is automatically fully tested through unitary tests and code coverage.
Please, note that previous version of Javasci remains available and shipped
into the Scilab distribution.
Advanced documentation and examples will be provided in the stable release of
Scilab 5.3.0.

Graphic export:
===============

Graphics:
=========

Thanks to Samuel Gougeon, many improvements on the polarplot function:
* Clipping was missing. See bug #7007.
* In some common cases, values of radial labels were wrong with respect to the
plotted radial frame or/and were lacking of digits.
* When the plot was centered around an angle far from 45°, the radial labels
were completely clipped.
* Sampling of the angular frame is improved according to the number of drawn
quadrants.
* Improved H&V positionning of angular labels
* Polar frame drawn in grey instead of black for a better data visibility.
* if the basic radius is >= 10^4 or <=10^-4, LaTeX is used to display smart
$..10^p$ exponents instead of the D+/-## console style display.
* Finally, their positioning is still improved in order to avoid their mutual
overlaying for big values.

  overwritten.

  Grayplot object's data seemed to be transposed when displayed.
