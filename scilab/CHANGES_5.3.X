  section.

Javasci:
========

A new version of the Java => Scilab API called Javasci v2 is now included into
the Scilab distribution.
This version fixes most the issues and limitations of the previous version.
This API is automatically fully tested through unitary tests and code coverage.
Please, note that previous version of Javasci remains available and shipped
into the Scilab distribution.
Advanced documentation and examples will be provided in the stable release of
Scilab 5.3.0.


License:
========

The license of all demos and examples have been changed to the 3-clause BSD
license. The domain public license was not valid in some countries.

  uimenus are no more (un)checked on mouse click. Moreover, they can now have
  a callback.

* The graph of the nyquist function (CACSD module) has been symetrized.


Xcos:
=====

* Loop link on a block produced some error when openning it.

* Bug 8081 fixed - The context was not checked before being set.

Graphic export:
===============

* Decrease the amount of feedbacks when exporting a graphic.


Graphics:
=========

Thanks to Samuel Gougeon, many improvements on the polarplot function:
* Clipping was missing. See Bug #7007.
* In some common cases, values of radial labels were wrong with respect to the
plotted radial frame or/and were lacking of digits.
* When the plot was centered around an angle far from 45°, the radial labels
were completely clipped.
* Sampling of the angular frame is improved according to the number of drawn
quadrants.
* Improved H&V positionning of angular labels
* Polar frame drawn in grey instead of black for a better data visibility.
* if the basic radius is >= 10^4 or <=10^-4, LaTeX is used to display smart
$..10^p$ exponents instead of the D+/-## console style display.
* Finally, their positioning is still improved in order to avoid their mutual
overlaying for big values.

* Bug 7110 fixed - When inserting a structure in a handle, the handle was
  overwritten.

* Bug 7492 fixed - If its "data_mapping" property was set to "direct", the
  Grayplot object's data seemed to be transposed when displayed.

                   generated a zero divide error.

                   managed by ATOMS. The cause of the issue is the behaviour of

                   was the most recent one even if it was not the case.

  directory name is now randomized and permissions are limited to the user
  (See Bug #3493).
