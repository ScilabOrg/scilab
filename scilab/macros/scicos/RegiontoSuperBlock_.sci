function RegiontoSuperBlock_()
//** 29 June 2006
//** Very complex and critical functions inside : handle with care ;)     

//** BEWARE: both functions ('do_region2block' and 'do_select2block' contains some 
//** completely un useful drawobj() operations inside the 'do_delete2' sub function
//** For the moment the drawobj() are not executed because this function ia called
//** with the options %f that disable the graphics update.
//** In all the cases the the situation is restored by the final "Replot" operation.

  if Select==[] then 
      //** if nothing is selected -> call a region selection function 
      [%pt, scs_m] = do_region2block(%pt,scs_m); //** see file: "do_region2block.sci"
      //** this type of operations is OK (old Scicos code here :)

    //** if the selected object are in the current window use the function below in this file 
    [%pt, scs_m] = do_select2block(%pt, scs_m);  //** ---> see below in this file :)
    //** with the last bugfix the 'Text' object are correctly handled, but this routine is
    //** much slower that the "old" standard mode.
