c
c    rkf45 is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff
c    differential equations when derivative evaluations are inexpensive.
c    rkf45 should generally not be used when the user is demanding
c    high accuracy.
c
c abstract
c
c    subroutine  rkf45  integrates a system of neqn first order
c    ordinary differential equations of the form
c             dy(i)/dt = fydot(t,y(1),y(2),...,y(neqn))
c              where the y(i) are given at t .
c    typically the subroutine is used to integrate from t to tout but it
c    can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a
c    single step in the direction of tout.  on return the parameters in
c    the call list are set for continuing the integration. the user has
c    only to call rkf45 again (and perhaps define a new value for tout).
c    actually, rkf45 is an interfacing routine which calls subroutine
c    rkfs for the solution.  rkfs in turn calls subroutine  fehl which
c    computes an approximate solution over one step.
c
c    rkf45  uses the runge-kutta-fehlberg (4,5)  method described
c    in the reference
c    e.fehlberg , low-order classical runge-kutta formulas with stepsize
c                 control , nasa tr r-315
c
c    the performance of rkf45 is illustrated in the reference
c    l.f.shampine,h.a.watts,s.davenport, solving non-stiff ordinary
c                 differential equations-the state of the art ,

c                 to appear in siam review.
c
c
c    the parameters represent-
c      fydot -- subroutine fydot(neqn,t,y,yp) to evaluate derivatives 
c             yp(i)=dy(i)/dt
c      neqn -- number of equations to be integrated
c      y(*) -- solution vector at t
c      t -- independent variable
c      tout -- output point at which solution is desired
c      rerr,aerr -- relative and absolute error tolerances for local
c            error test. at each step the code requires that
c                 abs(local error) .le. rerr*abs(y) + aerr
c            for each component of the local error and solution vectors
c      iflag -- indicator for status of integration
c      work(*) -- array to hold information internal to rkf45 which is
c            necessary for subsequent calls. must be dimensioned
c            at least  3+6*neqn
c      iwork(*) -- integer array used to hold information internal to
c            rkf45 which is necessary for subsequent calls. must be
c            dimensioned at least  5
c
c
c  first call to rkf45
c
c    the user must provide storage in his calling program for the arrays
c    in the call list  -      y(neqn) , work(3+6*neqn) , iwork(5)  ,
c    declare fydot in an external statement, supply 
c    subroutine fydot(neqn,t,y,yp)
c    and initialize the following parameters-
c
c      neqn -- number of equations to be integrated.  (neqn .ge. 1)
c      y(*) -- vector of initial conditions
c      t -- starting point of integration , must be a variable
c      tout -- output point at which solution is desired.
c            t=tout is allowed on the first call only, in which case
c            rkf45 returns with iflag=2 if continuation is possible.
c      rerr,aerr -- relative and absolute local error tolerances
c            which must be non-negative. rerr must be a variable while
c            aerr may be a constant. the code should normally not be
c            used with relative error control smaller than about 1.e-8 .
c            to avoid limiting precision difficulties the code requires
c            rerr to be larger than an internally computed relative
c            error parameter which is machine dependent. in particular,
c            pure absolute error is not permitted. if a smaller than
c            allowable value of rerr is attempted, rkf45 increases
c            rerr appropriately and returns control to the user before
c            continuing the integration.
c      iflag -- +1,-1  indicator to initialize the code for each new
c            problem. normal input is +1. the user should set iflag=-1
c            only when one-step integrator control is essential. in this
c            case, rkf45 attempts to advance the solution a single step
c            in the direction of tout each time it is called. since this
c            mode of operation results in extra computing overhead, it
c            should be avoided unless needed.
c
c
c  output from rkf45
c
c      y(*) -- solution at t
c      t -- last point reached in integration.
c      iflag = 2 -- integration reached tout. indicates successful retur
c                   and is the normal mode for continuing integration.
c            =-2 -- a single successful step in the direction of tout
c                   has been taken. normal mode for continuing
c                   integration one step at a time.
c            = 3 -- integration was not completed because relative error
c                   tolerance was too small. rerr has been increased
c                   appropriately for continuing.
c            = 4 -- integration was not completed because more than
c                   3000 derivative evaluations were needed. this
c                   is approximately 500 steps.
c            = 5 -- integration was not completed because solution
c                   vanished making a pure relative error test
c                   impossible. must use non-zero aerr to continue.
c                   using the one-step integration mode for one step
c                   is a good way to proceed.
c            = 6 -- integration was not completed because requested
c                   accuracy could not be achieved using smallest
c                   allowable stepsize. user must increase the error
c                   tolerance before continued integration can be
c                   attempted.
c            = 7 -- it is likely that rkf45 is inefficient for solving
c                   this problem. too much output is restricting the
c                   natural stepsize choice. use the one-step integrator
c                   mode.
c            = 8 -- invalid input parameters
c                   this indicator occurs if any of the following is
c                   satisfied -   neqn .le. 0
c                                 t=tout  and  iflag .ne. +1 or -1
c                                 rerr or aerr .lt. 0.
c                                 iflag .eq. 0  or  .lt. -2  or  .gt. 8
c      work(*),iwork(*) -- information which is usually of no interest
c                   to the user but necessary for subsequent calls.
c                   work(1),...,work(neqn) contain the first derivatives
c                   of the solution vector y at t. work(neqn+1) contains
c                   the stepsize h to be attempted on the next step.
c                   iwork(1) contains the derivative evaluation counter.
c
c
c  subsequent calls to rkf45
c
c    subroutine rkf45 returns with all information needed to continue
c    the integration. if the integration reached tout, the user only
c    needs to define a new tout and call rkf45 again. in the one-step
c    integrator mode (iflag=-2) the user must keep in mind that each
c    step taken is in the direction of the current tout. upon reaching
c    tout (indicated by changing iflag to 2),the user must then define
c    a new tout and reset iflag to -2 to continue in the one-step
c    integrator mode.
c
c    if the integration was not completed but the user still wants to
c    continue (iflag=3,4 cases), he just calls rkf45 again. with iflag=3
c    the rerr parameter has been adjusted appropriately for continuing
c    the integration. in the case of iflag=4 the function counter will
c    be reset to 0 and another 3000 function evaluations are allowed.
c
c    however,in the case iflag=5, the user must first alter the error
c    criterion to use a positive value of aerr before integration can
c    proceed. if he does not,execution is terminated.
c
c    also,in the case iflag=6, it is necessary for the user to reset
c    iflag to 2 (or -2 when the one-step integration mode is being used)
c    as well as increasing either aerr,rerr or both before the
c    integration can be continued. if this is not done, execution will
c    be terminated. the occurrence of iflag=6 indicates a trouble spot
c    (solution is changing rapidly,singularity may be present) and it
c    often is inadvisable to continue.
c
c    if iflag=7 is encountered, the user should use the one-step
c    integration mode with the stepsize determined by the code or
c    consider switching to the adams codes de/step,intrp. if the user
c    insists upon continuing the integration with rkf45, he must reset
c    iflag to 2 before calling rkf45 again. otherwise,execution will be
c    terminated.
c
c    if iflag=8 is obtained, integration can not be continued unless
c    the invalid input parameters are corrected.
c
c    it should be noted that the arrays work,iwork contain information
c    required for subsequent integration. accordingly, work and iwork
c    should not be altered.

c     core integrator for taking a single step
c
c     the tolerances have been scaled to avoid premature underflow in
c     computing the error tolerance function et.
c     to avoid problems with zero crossings,relative error is measured
c     using the average of the magnitudes of the solution at the
c     beginning and end of a step.
c     the error estimate formula has been grouped to control loss of
c     significance.
c     to distinguish the various arguments, h is not permitted
c     to become smaller than 26 units of roundoff in t.
c     practical limits on the change in the stepsize are enforced to
c     smooth the stepsize selection process and to avoid excessive
c     chattering on problems having discontinuities.
c     to prevent unnecessary failures, the code uses 9/10 the stepsize
c     it estimates will succeed.
c     after a step failure, the stepsize is not allowed to increase for
c     the next attempted step. this makes the code more efficient on
c     problems having discontinuities and more effective in general
c     since local extrapolation is being used and extra caution seems
c     warranted.

c    fehl integrates a system of neqn first order
c    ordinary differential equations of the form

c    where the initial values y(i) and the initial derivatives
c    yp(i) are specified at the starting point t. fehl advances
c    the solution over the fixed step h and returns
c    the fifth order (sixth order accurate locally) solution
c    approximation at t+h in array s(i).
c    f1,---,f5 are arrays of dimension neqn which are needed
c    for internal storage.
