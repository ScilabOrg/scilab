      integer function fout(lsize,alpha,beta,s,p)

      integer lsize
      double precision alpha,beta,s,p
c!purpose
c      this function checks if
c       the real root alpha/beta lies outside the unit disc
c       (if lsize=1)
c       the complex conjugate roots with sum s and product p lie
c       outside the unit disc (if lsize=2).
c      if so, fout=1, otherwise, fout=-1
c      in this function the parameter s is not referenced
