/**
 *  Iso contour with grey level or colors
 *  for a function defined by finite elements
 *  (f is linear on triangles)
 *  we give two versions of the function :
 *     - a quick version wich only fill triangles according to the average
 *     value of f on a triangle (no more such version now ?)
 *     - and a slow version but more sexy which use the fact that f is linear
 *     on each triangle.
 *  Nodes (x[no],y[no])
 *  Triangles (Matrix: [ numero, no1,no2,no3,iflag;...]
 *  func[no] : Function value on Nodes.
 *  Nnode : number of nodes
 *  Ntr   : number of triangles
 *  strflag,legend,brect,aint : see plot2d
 *  zminmax   : to set (optionaly) the min and max level
 *  colminmax : to set (optionaly) the first and last color to use
 *
 *  modified by Bruno Pincon 01/02/2001 for gain in speed and added
 *  possibilities to set zmin, zmax by the user and also to set the
 *  first and last color of the colormap (Bruno.Pincon@iecn.u-nancy.fr)
