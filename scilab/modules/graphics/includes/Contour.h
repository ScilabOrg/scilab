 * Draw level curves for a function f(x,y) which values

 * - z is a (n1,n2) matrix
 * - x is a (1,n1) matrix
 * - y is a (1,n2) matrix
 * - x,y,z are stored as one dimensional array in C
 * - if *flagnz =0
 * -   then  nz is an int pointer to the number of level curves.
 *     else  zz is an array which gives th requested level values.
 *            (and nz is the size of thos array)
 * Computed from min and max of z
 * Example Contour(1:5,1:10,rand(5,10),5);
