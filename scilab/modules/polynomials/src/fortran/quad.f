      subroutine quad(a, b1, c, sr, si, lr, li)
c calculate the zeros of the quadratic a*z**2+b1*z+c.
c the quadratic formula, modified to avoid
c overflow, is used to find the larger zero if the
c zeros are real and both zeros are complex
c the smaller real zero is found directly from the
c product of the zero c/a.
