/**
 * TitlePositioner class.
 *
 * Computes the position of a Label in box coordinates [-1, +1]^3, as used
 * when rulers are drawn {@see AxesDrawer}, where -1 and +1 respectively map
 * to the corresponding axis' maximum and minimum bounds.
 * Automatic positioning uses the middle of the Axes box's projection's top segment
 * as a reference point. In order to keep the Title label fixed when the viewpoint changes,
 * its position is first computed in window coordinates (viewpoint-independent), using
 * the reference point, and is then unprojected to obtain the anchor point's position
 * in box coordinates (depends on the viewpoint).
 *
 * To do:
 *    -take into account label text angle and automatic rotation.
 *    -take into account logarithmic coordinates.
 *    -implement window-coordinates displacement computation.
