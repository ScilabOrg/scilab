/**
 * @remark There is a need for cleverer macros in this module. Indeed,
 * every sci_cdf file follows the same pattern. However, I won't go
 * any further on this way since:
 *
 * 1. I frown upon encapsulating returns in macros (beacause it cheats
 * on standard C interpreting). And I am reluctant to declare unscoped
 * variables in macros to be used out of the macro's body (because of
 * side effects and code obfuscating). But C89 doesn't allow
 * expressions like (int t, &t). Hence, I see no (clean) way out.
 *
 * 2. No comma inside a macro arguments is allowed. i.e. cpp reads 3
 * arguments in such a macro call as mac({1, 2, 3}). On the other
 * hand, I won't write bracing macros (two complementary macros
 * starting and ending a block) because it's a pain to write neatly,
 * it has unexpected side effets w.r.t. standard C interpretation.
