function t=trimmean(x,discard,orien, verbose)
    //
    //A  trimmed mean  is calculated  by discarding  a certain
    //percentage of the lowest and the highest scores and then
    //computing  the  mean   of  the  remaining  scores.   For
    //example, a  mean trimmed  50% is computed  by discarding
    //the lower  and higher 25%  of the scores and  taking the
    //mean of the remaining scores.
    //
    //The median  is the mean trimmed 100%  and the arithmetic
    //mean is the mean trimmed 0%.
    //
    //A  trimmed mean  is  obviously less  susceptible to  the
    //effects of  extreme scores than is  the arithmetic mean.
    //It is therefore less susceptible to sampling fluctuation
    //than the mean for  extremely skewed distributions. It is
    //less  efficient (The  efficiency of  a statistic  is the
    //degree to  which the statistic is stable  from sample to
    //sample.    That  is,  the   less  subject   to  sampling
    //fluctuation  a  statistic  is,  the  more  efficient  it
    //is. The efficiency of statistics is measured relative to
    //the  efficiency  of other  statistics  and is  therefore
    //often called the relative efficiency. If statistic A has
    //a  smaller   standard  error  than   statistic  B,  then
    //statistic  A is  more efficient  than statistic  B.  The
    //relative efficiency of two  statistics may depend on the
    //distribution involved.   For instance, the  mean is more
    //efficient than  the median for  normal distributions but
    //not  for  some   extremely  skewed  distributions.   The
    //efficiency of a statistic can  also be thought of as the
    //precision  of  the  estimate:  The  more  efficient  the
    //statistic,  the  more precise  the  statistic  is as  an
    //estimator         of         the         parameter.[from
    //http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/A12977.html])  than  the
    //mean for normal distributions.
    //
    //Trimmed  means  are often  used  in  Olympic scoring  to
    //minimize the effects  of extreme ratings possibly caused
    //by            biased            judges.            [from
    //http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/A11971.html]

    //For a vector  or matrix x, t=trimmean(x,discard) returns
    //in  scalar t the  mean of  all the  entries of  x, after
    //discarding discard/2 highest values and discard/2 lowest
    //values.
    //
    //t=trimmean(x,discard,'r')       (or,       equivalently,
    //t=trimmean(x,discard,1))  returns in  each entry  of the
    //row vector t the trimmed mean of each column of x.
    //
    //t=trimmean(x,discard,'c')       (or,       equivalently,
    //t=trimmean(x,discard,2))  returns in  each entry  of the
    //column vector t the trimmed mean of each row of x.
