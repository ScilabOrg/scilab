function [m]=nanmeanf(val,fre,orient)
    //
    //This function returns in scalar m the mean of the values (ignoring the
    //NANs) of  a  vector  or  matrix  val, each counted  with   a frequency
    //signaled by the  corresponding values of the  integer vector or matrix
    //fre with the same type of val.
    //
    //For     a   vector   or      matrix   val,   m=nanmeanf(val,fre)    or
    //m=nanmeanf(val,fre,'*')    returns in scalar  m  the   mean of all the
    //entries (ignoring   the NANs) of   val, each  value  counted  with the
    //multiplicity indicated by the corresponding value of fre.
    //
    //m=nanmeanf(val,fre,'r')(or,     equivalently,   m=nanmeanf(val,fre,1))
    //returns in each entry of the row vector m  of type 1xsize(val,'c') the
    //mean of each column  of  val (ignoring  the NANs), each  value counted
    //with the multiplicity indicated by the corresponding value of fre.
    //
    //m=nanmeanf(val,fre,'c')(or,   equivalently,     m=nanmeanf(val,fre,2))
    //returns in each  entry of the column  vector m of type size(val,'c')x1
    //the mean of  each row of val  (ignoring the NANs),  each value counted
    //with the multiplicity indicated by the corresponding value of fre.
