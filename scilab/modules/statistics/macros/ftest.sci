function [f,p]=ftest(samples)
    //
    //Given a  number nc of samples each  of them composed of nr
    //observations this fonction computes in f the Fischer ratio
    //(it is the  ratio between  nr times  the variance   of the
    //means of  samples  and the  mean of the  variances of each
    //sample).  Additionnally it gives (in p) the p-value of the
    //computed  Fischer ratio.  samples   is a matrix  with type
    //nrxnc.
