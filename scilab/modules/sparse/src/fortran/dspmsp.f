      subroutine dspmsp(p,q,r,a,nela,inda,b,nelb,indb,c,nelc,indc,
     $     ib,ic,x,xb,ierr)
c multiply sparse matrices by the method of gustafson,acm t.o.m.s.
c  vol 4 (1978) p250.
c*** input
c p           number of rows in a,
c q           number of columns in a
c r           number of columns in b
c a            a one-dimensional array containing the non-zero elements
c                of the first matrix,arranged row-wise, but not
c                necessarily in order within rows.
c nela        number of non-zero elements in a
c inda(i)     1<=i<=p number of non-zero elements in row i of a.
c inda(p+i)   1<=i<nela column index of i'th non-zero element of a.

c b,nelb,indb as a,nela,inda but for second matrix.
c nelc        maximum non zero element for the result

c*** output
c c,nelc,indc  as a,nela,inda but for result matrix.
c c            a one-dimensional array containing the non-zero elements
c                of the product matrix,arranged row-by-row,but not
c                usually in order within rows.
c             ordering by increasing column number may be attained
c               by subsequently calling trsmgu twice,i.e.:
c     call trsmgu(c,mc,ic,ct,mct,ict)
c     call trsmgu(ct,mct,ic,c,mc,ic)
c               where ct,mct,ict are working storage areas of
c               same dimension as c,mc,ic respectively.
c ierr        =1 if space exceeded in c
c             =0 otherwise.
c*** working storage parameters.
c  ib         ib(i) is address in b of first element of row i of b.
c               ib(number of rows +1)=number of elements in b,+1.
