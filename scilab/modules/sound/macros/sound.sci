    //SOUND Play vector as sound.
    //   SOUND(Y,FS) sends the signal in vector Y (with sample frequency
    //   FS) out to the speaker on platforms that support sound. Values in
    //   Y are assumed to be in the range -1.0 <= y <= 1.0. Values outside
    //   that range are clipped.  Stereo sounds are played, on platforms
    //   that support it, when Y is an N-by-2 matrix.
    //
    //   SOUND(Y) plays the sound at the default sample rate of 22050 Hz.
    //
    //   SOUND(Y,FS,BITS) plays the sound using BITS bits/sample if
    //   possible.  Most platforms support BITS=8 or 16.
    //
    //   See also SOUNDSC.
