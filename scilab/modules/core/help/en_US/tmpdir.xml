    <para>
      The <literal>TMPDIR</literal> constant holds the temporary
      directory absolute path of a Scilab process. Each Scilab process
      has its own temporary directory, created and referenced to
      <literal>TMPDIR</literal> during Scilab startup. The
      <literal>TMPDIR</literal> constant cannot be altered. The
      temporary directory is deleted when Scilab stops.
