*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  XERBLA  is an error handler for the LAPACK routines.
*  It is called by an LAPACK routine if an input parameter has an
*  invalid value.  A message is printed and execution stops.
*
*  Installers may consider modifying the STOP statement in order to
*  call system-specific exception-handling facilities.
*
*  Arguments

*
*  SRNAME  (input) CHARACTER*6
*          The name of the routine which called XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (input) INTEGER
*          The position of the invalid parameter in the parameter list
*          of the calling routine.
