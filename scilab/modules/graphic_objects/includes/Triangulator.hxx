 * Triangulator class
 * An implementation of the ear-clipping triangulation algorithm,
 * an O(n^2) complexity algorithm, when n is the triangulated polygon's
 * number of points. The polygon must be simple and non-intersecting.
 * Triangulation occurs as if the polygon were plane, which is why only
 * its two largest dimensions are considered and the third is ignored.
 *
 * To do:
 *    -extend to take into account self-intersecting polygons
 *    -use a more efficient and robust algorithm (such as the decomposition into monotone pieces O(n log n) algorithm)
 *    -use a dedicated library (more efficient and/or robust)
