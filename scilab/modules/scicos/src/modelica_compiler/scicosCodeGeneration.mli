(** This module provides functions that generate code for the Scicos target. *)

val generate_code : string -> string -> string -> Optimization.model -> bool
  -> bool -> string option * string option -> unit
(** [generate_code path filename fun_name model jac only_outputs
     init_filenames]
generates the
code that permits the numeric simulation of [model]. [path] is the path to the
external functions referenced in [model]. [filename] is the name of the file
where the code is generated. [fun_name] is the name of the entry point in the
generated code. [jac] is a flag which true value indicates that a symbolic
jacobian is requested. [only_outputs] indicates that only output variables
have to be observed (this is the only possibility under Scicos so setting it
to [false] has no effect on code generation). [init_filenames] gives the
name of the initialization file so that initialization code is generated. *)
