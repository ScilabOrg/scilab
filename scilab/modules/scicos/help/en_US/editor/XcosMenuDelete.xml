    <para>
      To delete editors objects ( blocks links or texts), <link
      linkend="XcosSelect">select</link> the desired objects
      then activate this menu.  It is also possible to first activate
      the menu and then to select the object to be deleted.
    </para>
    <para>
      When a block is deleted all the connected links are also
      deleted. In a similar way when a link is deleted all the links
      issued from this links are also deleted. This mechanism insure
      that no unconnected links may exist.
