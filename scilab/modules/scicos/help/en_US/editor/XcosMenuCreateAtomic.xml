    <title>Description</title>
    <para>
      A regular <link linkend="SUPER_f">Super Block</link> is just a
      graphical facility to make diagrams more readable and
      modular. When such Super Block exists in a diagram the
      compilation process replace them by their flat equivalent. It is
      some time interesting to consider a Super Block as an atomic
      block (treated by the editor and the compiler as a single
      elementary block)
    </para>
    <para>
      This menu applies to a single <link
      linkend="XcosSelect">selected</link> Super Block, transforming
      it into an atomic superblock.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the current version the transformation to an atomic super
      block uses the <link linkend="XcosMenuCodeGeneration">code generation
      tool</link>.
    </para>
  </refsection>
  <refsection>
    <title>Remarks</title>
    <para>
      If the Super Block contains continuous time states, The atomic
      super block calls a fixed step ODE solver to integrate the ODE
      part of the diagram. Consequently the behavior of the generated
      simulation function may not be exactly similar to the original
      super block.
   </para>
   <para>
      If the super block has several activation input ports the
      behavior of the atomic super block may not be exactly similar to
      the original super block due to different handling of
      asynchronous activations.
