    <para>
      This operation can only be applied to a masked block (see Create Mask operation).
      The result, the interfacing function of this block, is saved in an .sci file, which
      can be placed in any diagram/palette using the <link linkend="XcosMenuAddNewBlock">Add new block</link> operation.
      The interfacing function is loaded automatically for immediate use after the operation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that the resulting block is not a masked block; it is a compiled super block.
