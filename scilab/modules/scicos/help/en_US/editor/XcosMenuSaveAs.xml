    <para>
      Select the Save As menu item to save the block diagram or
      palette in a file. A dialog box allows choosing the file
      which must have a .cos or .cosf extension. The diagram
      takes the name of the file (without the extension).
      </para><para>
      If extension is ".cosf" an ASCII  formatted save is performed
      instead of binary save. Formatted save is slower than regular
      save.
