    <para>
      Export Scicos diagram and sub-diagrams graphics in various
      formats. The graphs of the main diagram and all sub-diagrams
      (Super Blocks) are written to files in various graphic
      formats. 
      A graphic representation of the Super Blocks hierachy is also exported.
    </para>
    <para>
      When the menu is executed the user is first asked for a
      directory where the output files will be stored. It is then
      asked for the desired output format.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>"scg"</literal> format is the Scilab binary format
      used to save Scilab graphics.  Such files can be reloaded in
      Scilab using the <link linkend="load">load</link> function and
      regenerate a Scilab graphic window. The Scilab graphic editor
      and function can then be used to modify this graphic.
