    <para>
      In the main Scicos window, clicking on the Setup menu item
      invokes a dialog box that allows you to change
      integration parameters:
      </para><para>
      - Final integration time (integration ends at
      this time, it always starts from 0),
      </para><para>
      - Real time scaling (forces real time simulation
      by setting Scicos unit of time to 1 second),
      </para><para>
      - Absolute and relative error tolerances (solver properties),
      </para><para>
      - Time tolerance (the smallest time interval for which
      the ode solver is used to update continuous states),
      </para><para>
      - Max integration time interval (the maximum time interval
      for each call to solver, it must be reduced if the error
      message "too many calls" is encountered),
      </para><para>
      - Solver (choose the numerical solver to be used),
      </para><para>
      Max step size (max time step taken by solver).
