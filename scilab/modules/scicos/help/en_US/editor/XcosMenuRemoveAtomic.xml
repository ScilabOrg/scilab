    <para>
      This menu applies only to an already atomic superblock. It
      removes the atomicity so the internal definition of the Super
      Block can be inspected and edited.
    </para>
    <para>
      To operate first <link linkend="XcosSelect">select</link> the
      desired atomic super block then activate the menu or activate
      the menu and click on the desired block.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the super block has several activation input ports the
     behavior of the atomic super block may not be exactly similar to
     the regular super block due to different handling of asynchronous
     activations.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that the icon of the Super Block remains the same as that
      of the atomic super block.
