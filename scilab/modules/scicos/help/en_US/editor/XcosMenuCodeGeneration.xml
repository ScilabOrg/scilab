    <title>Description</title>
    <para>
      This menu allows to generate the C code of the simulation function associated with
      a  <link linkend="SUPER_f">Super Block</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The code generation is obtained simply by <link
      linkend="XcosSelect">selecting</link> a Super block
      and then the <literal>Code Generation</literal> menu.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the Super Block satisfies the required conditions, a dialog box
      pops up to ask for a block name, a directory where to put the
      generated files and for optional libraries requested by the linker.
    </para>
    <para>
      Given this information the code is generated, compiled and linked with
      Scilab. The Super Block is automatically replaced by a new block which
      implements the generated code. It is then possible to run the modified
      diagram. The code for standalone use is also generated.
    </para>

  <refsection>
    <title>Important remarks</title>
    <para>
      If the super block contains continuous time states, generated C
      code calls a fixed step ODE solver to integrate the ODE part of
      the diagram. Consequently the behavior of the generated
      simulation function may not be exactly similar to the original
      super block.
   </para>
   <para>
      If the super block has several activation input ports the
      behavior of the generated simulation function may not be exactly
      similar to the original super block due to different handling of
      asynchronous activations.
