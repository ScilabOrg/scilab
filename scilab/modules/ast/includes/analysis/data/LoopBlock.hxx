      A loop block naturally contains phi nodes:
      a = 0;
      b = 1;
      for i=1:N
      a = a + b // the values of a and b depends from where we come
      // a = phi(before loop, end loop) + phi(before loop, end loop)
      b = b + int8(1) // b = phi(before loop, end loop) + int8(1)
      end
      So we can suppose three cases:
      i) we don't enter in the loop => easy: we just ignore the loop
      ii) the loop has only one iteration => easy: the loop block is equivalent to a normal block
      iii) the loop has more than one iteration => types and refcounts need to be computed again
      according to the inferred types and refcounts at the end of the loop.
      The best case (except empty loops) is when info are the same before and after one iteration.
      In the previous example, after one iteration a is typed double and b is int8 but after a second iteration
      a & b are int8.

      The problem is that in the most of the cases loops should have a lot of iterations so we can suppose with a
      good probability that inferred types after the loop should be ones guessed after two iterations.
