*        val(0..n) being an array (with strict increasing order and n >=1)
*        representing intervals, this routine, by the mean of a

*                             = 0 if  X(i) is not in [val(0),val(n)]
*
*           b/ the number of points falling in the interval j :

*         and  occ(1) = # { X(i) such that X(i) in [val(0), val(1)] }
*             
*     PARAMETERS
*        inputs :
