      subroutine cbal(nm,n,ar,ai,low,igh,scale)
c
      integer i,j,k,l,m,n,jj,nm,igh,low,iexc

c
c!purpose
c
c     this subroutine balances a complex matrix and isolates
c     eigenvalues whenever possible.
c
c!calling sequence
c     subroutine cbal(nm,n,ar,ai,low,igh,scale)
c
c     integer n,nm,igh,low
c     double precision ar(nm,n),ai(nm,n),scale(n)
c     logical noconv
c
c     on input:
c
c        nm must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
c          array parameters as declared in the calling program
c          dimension statement;
c
c        n is the order of the matrix;
c
c        ar and ai contain the real and imaginary parts,
c          respectively, of the complex matrix to be balanced.
c
c     on output:
c
c        ar and ai contain the real and imaginary parts,
c          respectively, of the balanced matrix;
c
c        low and igh are two integers such that ar(i,j) and ai(i,j)
c          are equal to zero if
c           (1) i is greater than j and
c           (2) j=1,...,low-1 or i=igh+1,...,n;
c
c        scale contains information determining the
c           permutations and scaling factors used.
c
c     suppose that the principal submatrix in rows low through igh
c     has been balanced, that p(j) denotes the index interchanged
c     with j during the permutation step, and that the elements
c     of the diagonal matrix used are denoted by d(i,j).  then
c        scale(j) = p(j),    for j = 1,...,low-1
c                 = d(j,j)       j = low,...,igh
c                 = p(j)         j = igh+1,...,n.
c     the order in which the interchanges are made is n to igh+1,
c     then 1 to low-1.
c
c     note that 1 is returned for igh if igh is zero formally.
c
c     the algol procedure exc contained in cbalance appears in
c     cbal  in line.  (note that the algol roles of identifiers
c     k,l have been reversed.)
c
c     arithmetic is real throughout.
c
c!originator
c     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure
c     cbalance, which is a complex version of balance,
