c     CHANGES : - (Bruno on 2001 May 22) for ysptrk use a
c                 minimax polynome to enlarge the special
c                 evaluation zone |s| < SLIM. Also rename
c                 this function as lnp1m1.
c               - (Bruno on 2001 June 7) better handling
c                 of spurious over/underflow ; remove
c                 the call to pythag ; better accuracy
c                 in the real part for z near +-i

c
c     ALGORITHM : noting z = a + i*b, we have:
c        Z = yr + yi*b = arctan(z) = (i/2) * log( (i+z)/(i-z) )
c
c     This function has two branch points at +i and -i and the
c     chosen  branch cuts are the two half-straight lines
c     D1 = [i, i*oo) and D2 = (-i*oo, i].  The function is then
c     analytic in C \ (D1 U D2)).
c
c     From the definition it follows that:
c
c        yr = 0.5 Arg ( (i+z)/(i-z) )                   (1)
c        yi = 0.5 log (|(i+z)/(i-z)|)                   (2)
c
c     so lim (z -> +- i) yr = undefined (and Nan is logical)
c        lim (z -> +i)   yi = +oo
c        lim (z -> -i)   yi = -oo
c
c     The real part of arctan(z) is discontinuous across D1 and D2
c     and we impose the following definitions:
c         if imag(z) > 1 then
c             Arg(arctan(z)) =  pi/2 (=lim real(z) -> 0+)
c         if imag(z) < 1 then
c             Arg(arctan(z)) = -pi/2 (=lim real(z) -> 0-)
c
c
c     Basic evaluation: if we write (i+z)/(i-z) using
c     z = a + i*b, we get:
c
c     i+z    1-(a**2+b**2) + i*(2a)
c     --- =  ----------------------
c     i-z       a**2 + (1-b)**2
c
c     then, with r2 = |z|^2 = a**2 + b**2 :
c
c     yr = 0.5 * Arg(1-r2 + (2*a)*i)
c        = 0.5 * atan2(2a, (1-r2))                      (3)
c
c     This formula is changed when r2 > RMAX (max pos float)
c     and also when |1-r2| and |a| are near 0 (see comments
c     in the code).
c
c     After some math:
c
c     yi = 0.25 * log( (a**2 + (b + 1)**2) /
c                      (a**2 + (b - 1)**2) )            (4)
c
c     Evaluation for "big" |z|
c     ------------------------
c
c     If |z| is "big", the direct evaluation of yi by (4) may
c     suffer of innaccuracies and of spurious overflow.  Noting
c     that  s = 2 b / (1 + |z|**2), we have:
c
c     yi = 0.25 log ( (1 + s)/(1 - s) )                 (5)
c
c                                3        5
c     yi = 0.25*( 2 * ( s + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s  + ... ))
c
c     yi = 0.25 * lnp1m1(s)    if  |s| < SLIM
c
c     So if |s| is less than SLIM we switch to a special
c     evaluation done by the function lnp1m1. The
c     threshold value SLIM is chosen by experiment
c     (with the Pari-gp software). For |s|
c     "very small" we used a truncated taylor dvp,
c     else a minimax polynome (see lnp1m1).
c
c     To avoid spurious overflows (which result in spurious
c     underflows for s) in computing s with s= 2 b / (1 + |z|**2)
c     when |z|^2 > RMAX (max positive float) we use :
c
c            s = 2d0 / ( (a/b)*a + b )
c
c     but if |b| = Inf  this formula leads to NaN when
c     |a| is also Inf. As we have :
c
c            |s| <= 2 / |b|
c
c     we impose simply : s = 0  when |b| = Inf
c
c     Evaluation for z very near to i or -i:
c     --------------------------------------
c     Floating point numbers of the form a+i or a-i with 0 <
c     a**2 < tiny (approximately 1d-308) may lead to underflow
c     (i.e., a**2 = 0) and the logarithm will break formula (4).
c     So we switch to the following formulas:
c
c     If b = +-1 and |a| < sqrt(tiny) approximately 1d-150 (say)
c     then (by using that a**2 + 4 = 4 in machine for such a):
c
c         yi = 0.5 * log( 2/|a| )   for b=1
c
c         yi = 0.5 * log( |a|/2 )   for b=-1
c
c     finally: yi = 0.5 * sign(b) * log( 2/|a| )
c              yi = 0.5 * sign(b) * (log(2) - log(|a|)) (6)
c
c     The last trick is to avoid overflow for |a|=tiny!  In fact
c     this formula may be used until a**2 + 4 = 4 so that the
c     threshold value may be larger.

c
c     PURPOSE :  Compute   v = log ( (1 + s)/(1 - s) )
c        for small s, this is for |s| < SLIM = 0.20
c
c     ALGORITHM :
c     1/ if |s| is "very small" we use a truncated
c        taylor dvp (by keeping 3 terms) from :
c                               2        4          6
c        t = 2 * s * ( 1 + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s  + [ 1/7 s  + ....] )
c                               2        4
c        t = 2 * s * ( 1 + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s  + er)
c
c        The limit E until we use this formula may be simply
c        gotten so that the negliged part er is such that :
c                                    2        4
c        (#) er <= epsm * ( 1 + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s )   for all |s|<= E
c
c        As  er  = 1/7 s^6 + 1/9 s^8 + ...
c            er <= 1/7 * s^6 ( 1 + s^2 + s^4 + ...) = 1/7  s^6/(1-s^2)
c
c        the inequality (#) is forced if :
c
c        1/7  s^6 / (1-s^2)  <= epsm * ( 1 + 1/3 s^2  + 1/5 s^4 )
c
c        s^6 <= 7 epsm * (1 - 2/3 s^2 - 3/15 s^4 - 1/5 s^6)
c
c        So that E is very near (7 epsm)^(1/6) (approximately 3.032d-3):
c
c     2/ For larger |s| we used a minimax polynome :
c
c        yi = s * (2  + d3 s^3 + d5 s^5 .... + d13 s^13 + d15 s^15)
c
c        This polynome was computed (by some remes algorithm) following
