     CHANGES : - (Bruno on 2001 May 22) for ysptrk use a 
                 minimax polynome to enlarge the special
                 evaluation zone |s| < SLIM. Also rename
                 this function as lnp1m1.
               - (Bruno on 2001 June 7) better handling
                 of spurious over/underflow ; remove
                 the call to pythag ; better accuracy
                 in the real part for z near +-i

     EXTERNALS FUNCTIONS

        lnp1m1  (at the end of this file)

     ALGORITHM : noting z = a + i*b, we have:
        Z = yr + yi*b = arctan(z) = (i/2) * log( (i+z)/(i-z) )
              
     This function has two branch points at +i and -i and the
     chosen  branch cuts are the two half-straight lines
     D1 = [i, i*oo) and D2 = (-i*oo, i].  The function is then
     analytic in C \ (D1 U D2)). 

     From the definition it follows that:

        yr = 0.5 Arg ( (i+z)/(i-z) )                   (1)
        yi = 0.5 log (|(i+z)/(i-z)|)                   (2)

     so lim (z -> +- i) yr = undefined (and Nan is logical)
        lim (z -> +i)   yi = +oo
        lim (z -> -i)   yi = -oo

     The real part of arctan(z) is discontinuous across D1 and D2
     and we impose the following definitions:
         if imag(z) > 1 then
             Arg(arctan(z)) =  pi/2 (=lim real(z) -> 0+)
         if imag(z) < 1 then
             Arg(arctan(z)) = -pi/2 (=lim real(z) -> 0-)
                 

     Basic evaluation: if we write (i+z)/(i-z) using
     z = a + i*b, we get:

     i+z    1-(a**2+b**2) + i*(2a)
     --- =  ---------------------- 
     i-z       a**2 + (1-b)**2

     then, with r2 = |z|^2 = a**2 + b**2 :
  
     yr = 0.5 * Arg(1-r2 + (2*a)*i)
        = 0.5 * atan2(2a, (1-r2))                      (3)

     This formula is changed when r2 > RMAX (max pos float)
     and also when |1-r2| and |a| are near 0 (see comments
     in the code).

     After some math:
             
     yi = 0.25 * log( (a**2 + (b + 1)**2) /
                      (a**2 + (b - 1)**2) )            (4)     
               
     Evaluation for "big" |z|
     ------------------------

     If |z| is "big", the direct evaluation of yi by (4) may
     suffer of innaccuracies and of spurious overflow.  Noting 
     that  s = 2 b / (1 + |z|**2), we have:

     yi = 0.25 log ( (1 + s)/(1 - s) )                 (5)

                                3        5    
     yi = 0.25*( 2 * ( s + 1/3 s  + 1/5 s  + ... ))

     yi = 0.25 * lnp1m1(s)    if  |s| < SLIM

     So if |s| is less than SLIM we switch to a special
     evaluation done by the function lnp1m1. The 
     threshold value SLIM is choosen by experiment 
     (with the Pari-gp software). For |s| 
     "very small" we used a truncated taylor dvp, 
     else a minimax polynome (see lnp1m1).

     To avoid spurious overflows (which result in spurious
     underflows for s) in computing s with s= 2 b / (1 + |z|**2)
     when |z|^2 > RMAX (max positive float) we use :

            s = 2d0 / ( (a/b)*a + b )
     
     but if |b| = Inf  this formula leads to NaN when
     |a| is also Inf. As we have :

            |s| <= 2 / |b|

     we impose simply : s = 0  when |b| = Inf

     Evaluation for z very near to i or -i:
     --------------------------------------
     Floating point numbers of the form a+i or a-i with 0 <
     a**2 < tiny (approximately 1d-308) may lead to underflow
     (i.e., a**2 = 0) and the logarithm will break formula (4).
     So we switch to the following formulas:

     If b = +-1 and |a| < sqrt(tiny) approximately 1d-150 (say)
     then (by using that a**2 + 4 = 4 in machine for such a):
         
         yi = 0.5 * log( 2/|a| )   for b=1
 
         yi = 0.5 * log( |a|/2 )   for b=-1

     finally: yi = 0.5 * sign(b) * log( 2/|a| )     
              yi = 0.5 * sign(b) * (log(2) - log(|a|)) (6)

     The last trick is to avoid overflow for |a|=tiny!  In fact
     this formula may be used until a**2 + 4 = 4 so that the
     threshold value may be larger.
