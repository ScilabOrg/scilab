c     To call a function it is required that its input arguments are
c     stored in the last positions of the variables stack (it is the
c     ase here. NOTE that when 
c     called, the function destroys its input variables and replaces them by 
c     the output variables. 

c     Here  function  takes  variables 1 and 2 as inputs and generates output
c     variables at positions 1.

c     ibegin must be the index of the first input variable of a_function
      ibegin=1

c     execute the disp function
      mlhs=1
      mrhs=2
      if(.not.scistring(ibegin,'disp',mlhs,mrhs)) return

c     check if an error has occured while running a_function
      if(err.gt.0) return

c     Note that disp, as every function which has nothing to return,
c     creates as output a variable with special type 0.

c     output variable: 

c     select index of variables to return
      lhsvar(1)=1
      return
      end
