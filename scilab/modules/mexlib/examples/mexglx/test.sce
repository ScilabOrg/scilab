// Linking a .mexglx, say foo.mexglx, file with Scilab.
// (Assuming foo.mexglx has been created by the Matlab's mex script).
// 0/ Here I create the file foo.mexglx using Scilab, just to have a
// proper foo.mexglx for testing

ilib_for_link("foo",["foo.o"],[],"c");
host("cp libfoo.so foo.mexglx");

// 1/ If necessary, create empty libmx.so libmex.so and libmat.so which
//    could be required by the .mexglx file.
//    (If "ldd foo.mexglx" shows a dependency).
// This is done by the following commands:

ilib_for_link("mx",[],[],"c");
ilib_for_link("mex",[],[],"c");
ilib_for_link("mat",[],[],"c");

// 2/link the (almost empty) .so files with Scilab
// Note that this is not really  usefull

//link ./libmx.so;
//link ./libmex.so;
//link ./libmat.so;

// 3/link foo.mexglx with Scilab
link ./foo.mexglx;

// 4/ Make a dynamic library with the provided C routine (libtst.c file).
//    Note that you can use libtst.c file as is and that the entrypoint
//    MUST BE mexFunction. If you have more than one mexglx files you
//    will need to copy libtst.c and change only the function name
//    (this is described below)

ilib_for_link("tst",["libtst.o"],[],"c");

//5/At Scilab prompt enter:

addinter("./libtst.so","libtst","foo");

// 6/call the mexfunction:

foo(5,"test string")
