        <title>Description</title>
        <para>
            Matlab and Scilab <literal>diag</literal> behave differently in some particular cases:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>    
                    With character string matrices: Scilab <literal>diag</literal> function considers each character string as an object
                    while Matlab considers each character individually.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>y = mtlb_diag(x[,dim])</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>y = diag(x[,dim])</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_diag</literal> calls:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>    
                    If <literal>x</literal> is not a character string matrix
                    <literal>y = mtlb_diag(x[,dim])</literal> may be replaced by <literal>y = diag(x[,dim])</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_diag</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
            </warning>
