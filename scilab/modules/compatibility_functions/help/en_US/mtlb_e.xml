        <para>Matlab and Scilab extraction behave differently in some particular cases:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When extracting data from a matrix with a vector as index: Matlab returns
                    a row vector and Scilab returns a column vector.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When extracting data from a character string matrix: due to the fact that character string matrices
                    in Matlab can be addressed as any other matrix (each character can be adressed), extraction in such a type of
                    matrix does not differ from other. But in Scilab it can't be done so and <literal>part</literal>
                    function has to be used. 
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>mtlb_e(B,k)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>A=B(k)</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_e</literal> calls:

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>    
                    If <literal>B</literal> is a vector
                    <literal>A=mtlb_e(B,k)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>A=B(k)</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>    
                    If <literal>B</literal> is a matrix
                    <literal>A=mtlb_e(B,k)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>A=B(k).'</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>    
                    If <literal>B</literal> is a character string matrix and
                    k is a scalar or a vector
                    <literal>A=mtlb_e(B,k)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>A=part(B,k)</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_e</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
