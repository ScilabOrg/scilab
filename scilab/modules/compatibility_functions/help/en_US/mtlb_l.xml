        <title>Description</title>
        <para>Matlab and Scilab left division behave differently in some particular cases:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>    
                    With character string operands: The <literal>\</literal> 
                    operator can not be used into Scilab with character strings, while
                    in Matlab it can. And in this case, result is transposed in a very strange way...
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>mtlb_l(A,B)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>A\B</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_l</literal> calls:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If both <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> are not character strings
                    <literal>mtlb_l(A,B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>A\B</literal>.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_l</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
            </warning>
