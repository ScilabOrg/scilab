        <para>
            Matlab and Scilab <literal>diff</literal> behave differently in some particular cases:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    With two input parameters: Scilab <literal>diff</literal> considers all values of first input as a vector
                    what Matlab does not.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    With three input parameters: If dimension of first input along dimension given by third parameter
                    reaches 1 before n interations
                    have been made,Matlab switches to next non-singleton dimension what Scilab does not.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>mtlb_diff(A[,n[,dim]])</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>diff(A[,n[,dim]])</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_diff</literal> calls:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    With two inputs, if <literal>A</literal> is a scalar or a vector
                    <literal>mtlb_diff(A,n)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>diff(A,n)</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    With three inputs, if size of A along dimension given by <literal>dim</literal> can not reach 1
                    <literal>mtlb_diff(A,n,dim)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>diff(A,n,dim)</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_diff</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
            </warning>
        </para>
