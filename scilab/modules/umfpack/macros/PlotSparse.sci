function [] = PlotSparse(A, style)
    //
    //  PURPOSE
    //     plot the pattern of non nul elements of a sparse matrix
    //
    //  ARGUMENTS
    //     A     : a sparse matrix
    //     style : (optional) a string given the color and/or the
    //             marker type of the form "[color][mark]" where
    //             color may be a number referring the color you
    //             want to use (in the current colormap). If you
    //             use the std colormap then color may be one of
    //             the following letters :
    //               k  for black       b  for blue
    //               r  for red         g  for green
    //               c  for cyan        m  for magenta
    //               y  for yellow      t  for turquoise
    //               G  a dark green
    //
    //             mark must be one of the following :
    //               .  point             +  plus
    //               x  cross             *  circled plus
    //               D  filled diamond    d  diamond
    //               ^  upper triangle    v  down triangle
    //               o  circle
    //
    //             by default you have "b." (in fact the 2d color) and
    //             this is also forced in case of error.
    //
    //  COMMENTS
    //     for "big" matrix use essentially point (.) as marker
    //
