function xk=mfft(x,flag,dim)
    //xk=mfft(x,flag,dim)
    //macro which calculates the fft for a multi-dimensional signal
    // x    :x(i,j,k,...) input signal in the form of a row vector
    //      :whose values are arranged so that the i index runs the
    //      :quickest, followed by the j index, etc.
    // flag :(-1) fft or (1) inverse fft
    // dim  :dimension vector which gives the number of
    //      :values of x for each of its indices
    // xk   :output of multidimensional fft in same format as for x
    //
    //Example: For a three dimensional vector which has three points
    //along its first dimension, two points along its second
    //dimension and three points along its third dimension the row
    //vector is arranged as follows
    //
    //      x=[x(1,1,1),x(2,1,1),x(3,1,1),...
    //         x(1,2,1),x(2,2,1),x(3,2,1),...
    //         x(1,1,2),x(2,1,2),x(3,1,2),...
    //         x(1,2,2),x(2,2,2),x(3,2,2),...
    //         x(1,1,3),x(2,1,3),x(3,1,3),...
    //         x(1,2,3),x(2,2,3),x(3,2,3)]
    //
    //and the dim vector is as follows
    //
    //      dim=[3,2,3]
    //
