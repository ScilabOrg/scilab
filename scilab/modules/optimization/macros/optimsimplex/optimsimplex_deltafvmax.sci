// optimsimplex_deltafvmax --
//   Returns the difference of function
//   value between the high and the low vertices.
//   It is expected that the vertex #1 is associated with
//   the smallest function value and that the vertex #nbve
//   is associated with the highest function value.
// Arguments
//   <no arg>
// Note
//   Since vertices are ordered, the high
//   is greater than the low.
