c   This program  by S. Steer INRIA for Scilab is derived from the 
c   Berwin A. Turlach code qpgen1 from solve.QP.compact.f.
c   This version uses a  more compact column-compressed sparse matrix storage:
c   the linear constraint matrix is supposed stored as follow
c   -  colnnz (q x 1) array (int) stores the number of non-zero entries  for
c   each column.
c   -  nzrindex (nnz x 1) array (int) stores the sequence of row index
c   of non-zero entries, for columns 1:q
c   -  (nnz x 1) array of non zero entries of A (dp) stored columnwise
c   replaced part of the code are commented with "corig"

c  this routine uses the Goldfarb/Idnani algorithm to solve the
c  following minimization problem:
c
c        minimize  -d^T x + 1/2 *  x^T D x
c        where   A1^T x  = b1
c                A2^T x >= b2
c
c  the matrix D is assumed to be positive definite.  Especially,
c  w.l.o.g. D is assumed to be symmetric.
c  
c  Input parameter:
c  dmat   nxn matrix, the matrix D from above (dp)
c         *** WILL BE DESTROYED ON EXIT ***
c         The user has two possibilities:
c         a) Give D (ierr=0), in this case we use routines from LINPACK
c            to decompose D.
c         b) To get the algorithm started we need R^-1, where D=R^TR.
c            So if it is cheaper to calculate R^-1 in another way (D may
c            be a band matrix) then with the general routine, the user
c            may pass R^{-1}.  Indicated by ierr not equal to zero.
c  dvec   nx1 vector, the vector d from above (dp)
c         *** WILL BE DESTROYED ON EXIT ***
c         contains on exit the solution to the inisolve.QP.compact.ftial, i.e.,
c         unconstrained problem
c  fddmat scalar, the leading dimension of the matrix dmat
c  n      the dimension of dmat and dvec (int)
c  amat   (nnz x 1) array of non zero entries of A (dp) stored column-wise
c         *** ENTRIES CORRESPONDING TO EQUALITY CONSTRAINTS MAY HAVE
c             CHANGED SIGNES ON EXIT ***
c  colnnz (q x 1) array (int) stores the number of non-zero entries of A for
c             each column.
c  nzrindex (nnz x 1) array (int) stores the row index  of non-zero entries of A 

c  bvec   qx1 vector, the vector of constants b in the constraints (dp)
c         [ b = (b1^T b2^T)^T ]
c         *** ENTRIES CORRESPONDING TO EQUALITY CONSTRAINTS MAY HAVE
c             CHANGED SIGNES ON EXIT ***
c  fdamat the first dimension of amat as declared in the calling program. 
c         fdamat >= n (and iamat must have fdamat+1 as first dimension)
c  q      integer, the number of constraints.
c  meq    integer, the number of equality constraints, 0 <= meq <= q.
c  ierr   integer, code for the status of the matrix D:
c            ierr =  0, we have to decompose D
c            ierr != 0, D is already decomposed into D=R^TR and we were
c                       given R^{-1}.
c
c  Output parameter:
c  sol   nx1 the final solution (x in the notation above)
c  crval scalar, the value of the criterion at the minimum      
c  iact  qx1 vector, the constraints which are active in the final
c        fit (int)
c  nact  scalar, the number of constraints active in the final fit (int)
c  iter  2x1 vector, first component gives the number of "main" 
c        iterations, the second one says how many constraints were
c        deleted after they became active
c  ierr  integer, error code on exit, if
c           ierr = 0, no problems
c           ierr = 1, the minimization problem has no solution
c           ierr = 2, problems with decomposing D, in this case sol
c                     contains garbage!!
