        <para>    
            Matlab and Scilab character strings are not considered in the same way.
            Here is a little talk about differences between them.
        </para>
        <para>
            Matlab considers a character string as Scilab considers a matrix of characters.
            For example, a Scilab equivalent for Matlab 'mystring' could be ["m","y","s","t","r","i","n","g"]. 
            So in Scilab, a character string is an object of type string (10) and always have size 1 x 1 but in Matlab, a character string have size equal to 1 x number_of_characters.
        </para>
        <para>
            Considering this, we can see that a Matlab character string matrix column can only be made of same-size character strings what is not true in Scilab. We can say that a Scilab character string matrix is equivalent to a Matlab cell of character strings.
        </para>
        <para>
            All these differences can lead to different results while executing same commands in Scilab or in Matlab, particularly for "dimension" functions such as length() or size().
