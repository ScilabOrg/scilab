* check memory leaks

* check what is the faster:
	- From java, send variable [][] and convert into the JNI into variable[][] with row & col size
	- From java, convert from [][] to [] directly and send it to the native code directly (avoid the conversion in the JNI)


* still provide v1

* Write documentation

* scilab error management

* if the function fails, .exec() should return false

* check that a java [][] dimensions are consistent

* move call_scilab.i into the right module (and helper)

* handle of complex data type

* handle of string data type

* handle of sparse data type

* handle of other data type (list, tlist, mlist)
