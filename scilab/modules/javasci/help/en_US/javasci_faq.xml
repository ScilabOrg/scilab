                <answer>
                    <para>org.scilab.modules.javasci.jar is probably not defined in the CLASSPATH. See

                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>Probably the java.library.path value has not been set. See

                    <para>The PATH environment variable may have not been set. See

                    <para>
                        If the error is something like: <emphasis role="italic">java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /path/to/scilab/lib/scilab/libscilab.so.0.0.0: libsciparameters.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</emphasis>, try to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path where Scilab native libraries are.

                    <para>
                        If the error is something like: <emphasis role="italic">java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\Program Files\scilab-XXXX\bin\javasci.dll: The specified procedure could not be found</emphasis>, your PATH environment variable may introduce a conflict between the Scilab libraries with other libraries on your system. Try to move (in the PATH variable) the Scilab path to the front of paths.

                    <para>
                        Make sure that you called the constructor (<emphasis role="italic">Scilab sci = new Scilab(true);</emphasis>) with the boolean value <emphasis role="italic">true</emphasis>. It starts Scilab in advanced mode.

                    <para>I would like to attach a graphic from Javasci to an existing Swing application. I don't know how to do that?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>Well. For now, it is not possible out of the box. The feature should be available in a future version of Scilab. As always, contributions are welcome!

                <question>
                    <para>I found the current way to manage Scilab graphic windows from javasci pretty hard. What should I do?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>This is embarassing. We are aware that the current solution is far from perfect. We hope we will be able to tackle this limitation in a future release.

                <question>
                    <para>
                        The Scilab instance has some external modules but fails to start with an <literal>undefined symbol:</literal>
                    </para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para><literal>
                            <emphasis role="italic">atomsLoad: An error occurred while loading 'module-0.0.2':	link : Library could not be loaded: /path/2.0-1/sci_gateway/c/../../src/cpp/libmy.so: undefined symbol: scirun_</emphasis>
                        </literal>
                        There are two potential solutions. First is to fix the module itself to build with the library providing the symbol. The second is to define the missing declared library with <literal>LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/the/lib/providing/the/symbol/libmy.so</literal>
