	+ Visual Studio 2008 express solution (fortran conversion with f2c) support
 - Dynamic libraries	
 - Atlas 3.8 support (Core 2 Duo and more support)
 - Intel Math Kernel Library support
 - Better support on Windows Vista


Dynamic/incremental link:
=========================
 - Module renamed to dynamic link
 - Visual Studio 2008 support
 - Intel Fortran 10 support on Windows
 - Under Linux/Unix, now based on basic autotools for the detection of compiler
	and compilation.
 - New functions:
        + getdynlibext - get the extension of dynamic libraries on your operating system.
 - Function improved:
        + ilib_for_link & ilib_build - now accept the actual filename (not only filename.o but also filename.c or filename.f)


TCL/TK:
=======
 - New event loop 
	+ Tcl/Tk thread separated from the Scilab one.

 - Provided with version 8.5 of TCL/TK
 - Removed Functions:
	+ demoplay is obsolete
	+ sciGUIhelp is obsolete 
 - Some TCL/related functions have been tagged as obsolete 
   (See http://wiki.scilab.org/obsolete_scilab_function )
 - TCL_CreateSlave now allows to create "safe" or "unsafe" slave interpreters (new option added).
   Default switched from safe to unsafe interp.


Java/Scilab API:
================
 - Refactoring of the Java API


Tests:
======
 - Tests are now embedded into Scilab (binary and sources)
 - Many tests added 
	+ Unitary
	+ Non regression
	+ Benchmarks
 - New functions:
        + test_run
        + unitary_test_run
        + nonreg_test_run

OTHERS IMPROVEMENTS:
====================
 - Update to the new version of Lapack (3.1.1)

Internal API:
=============
 - Used in functions GetRhsVar, PutLhsVar... The datatype naming have been 
	changed to:
	+ "c" => STRING_DATATYPE
	+ "S" => MATRIX_OF_STRING_DATATYPE
	+ "d" => MATRIX_OF_DOUBLE_DATATYPE
	+ "r" => MATRIX_OF_RATIONAL_DATATYPE
	+ "I" => MATRIX_OF_VARIABLE_SIZE_INTEGER_DATATYPE
	+ "i" => MATRIX_OF_INTEGER_DATATYPE
	+ "b" => MATRIX_OF_BOOLEAN_DATATYPE
	+ "z" => MATRIX_OF_COMPLEX_DATATYPE
	+ "s" => SPARSE_MATRIX_DATATYPE
	+ "l" => LIST_DATATYPE
	+ "t" => TYPED_LIST_DATATYPE
	+ "m" => MATRIX_ORIENTED_TYPED_LIST_DATATYPE
	+ "p" => SCILAB_POINTER_DATATYPE
	+ "h" => GRAPHICAL_HANDLE_DATATYPE
	+ "f" => EXTERNAL_DATATYPE
	These declarations are in modules/core/includes/stackTypeVariable.h
 - define TRUE_ and FALSE_ removed for TRUE and FALSE
 - Many other things... Have a look to the sources...


Scicos:
=======
 - Test framework currently under development:
        + Unitary tests
        + Non-regression tests (vs. Scicos 4.2 in Scilab 4.1.2)

Known incompatibilty
--------------------

  - The Metanet graph data structure has been completely redesigned
    see update_graph for translation, Graph saving is not more
    possible in a formatted way.

  - Due to a bug fix the xstringb x and y arguments meaning had
    changed "lower" and "left" are now relative to user coordinates
    order.

  - The xgetmouse flag option has been removed 

  - Due to license restrictions from the Universidad de Cantabria, the quapro 
	and linpro functions are no more available in the Scilab distribution, 
	but as an external toolbox.

  - Some uses of the pow function could cause issues for base ~ 1.0 and large
	exponent (See http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=706)
