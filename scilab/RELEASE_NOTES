                      Scilab 5.0 beta Release_Notes
                      ==============================

Please note that Scilab 5.0 beta version still contains some well known bug,
missing features and may have some slow behaviours.
It is a testing only version, it should only be used to test what will be
Scilab 5 family and not at all in production environment.
The period between the beta and the stable versions will mainly be used to
debug and optimize Scilab.

List of missing/buggy features:


- Uicontrols ascendant incompatibilities:
    * Figure size has to be increased because of the automatic insertion of
      a menubar and the height of the docking bar.
    * Popup uicontrols width has to be increased because of the little triangle
      used to select a new value.

- Graphics:
    * Graphic rendering is slower in a large graphic window than in a small 
      one.
    * Rendering is slow or not functional on some
      computer / graphic card / graphic card driver combination.
      Errors often appear on Intel cards under Linux and also with 
      old Nvidia or ATI drivers.
    * By default arcs and circles are now approximated using a constant number of lines.
      To switch to real arcs, set their arc_drawing_method property to "nurbs".
    * Sector boundary angles of arc objects are now specified in degree whereas it used to
      be specified in degree/64.
    * The text_box property of text objects now refers to user coordinates even in axes_reverse mode.
    * Bode routine creates only the two needed axes instead of four in previous versions.
    * graypolarplot routine is now constructed using a surface instead of arcs.
    * Some old poscript tools are not used anymore in Scilab and have been removed.
      The list of file removed form the Scilab bin directory is:
      BEpsf, Blatdoc, Blatdocs, Blatexpr, Blatexpr2, Blatexpr2, Blatexprs, Blpr and lpr
    * Pixel drawing mode property of figures is not compatible with Scilab 4.
      The result in Scilab 5 is inverted compared to the one in Scilab 4.
      For example the result of a white object drawn above a white background in "xor"
      mode will appear black (it was still white in Scilab 4).
      Moreover, the logical operators now works on the entire figure.
      In practice, the "xor" mode can be generally replaced by the "equiv" one. 
      


- It is strongly recommended to update graphic cards drivers to the latest 
	revision:
    * For ATI cards: http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html
    * For Intel cards: http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/
    * For Matrox cards: http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/certified/home.cfm
    * For NVIDIA cards: http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp
    * For S3 cards: http://www.s3graphics.com/en/resources/drivers/index.jsp  
    * For SiS cards: http://www.sis.com/download/
    * For VIA cards: http://www.viaarena.com/default.aspx?PageID=2


- Scicos:
    * The basic features of the editor are fully functional and tested.
    * Scicos code has been updated to the new event handling functions and code
      (please see "Event Handling Functions" section in "CHANGES") 
    * The Scicos simulation engine is correctly working (interactive as well as
      "scicos_simulate()" batch mode)
    * Demos are available through Scilab "?"->"Scilab Demonstrations" menu item
      ("Scicos" section) as well as Scicos "?"->"Demos" menu item
    * Tcl/Tk features are still inactive (eg. "Palette Tree")
    * "Export" and "Export All" features are now fully functional

- The Scipad debugger is broken because of code reorganization that has been
  performed in the Scilab core and rewriting of the Tcl interface. It has
  therefore been unplugged from Scipad

- Some Tcl/Scilab synchronisation issues have been reported.

- Printing can crash under Linux plateforms with recent versions of Cups.

- Scilab localization system is implemented, however not all the strings have
  been added to the translation engine and therefore not translated.

- Dynamic/incremental link bugs on unusual archs/compiler or with modified 
  flags and still have issues with the binary version of Scilab

- make install won't install the documentation.

- make install won't install the localization.

- The build process of a toolbox crashes on the documentation generation.

- It is not (yet, we hope) possible to build a file documentation file and add it into the documentation.

- A customization of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is going to be introduced 
  between the beta 4 & RC1

- Linux 64 bits version has some critical bugs.

- MacOS X version is not planned for Scilab 5.0 (probably 5.1)

- Some Linux distributions with SELinux enabled may prevent Scilab from running
  under the default security context. Newer Linux distributions have enabled 
  new kernel security extensions from the SELinux project at the NSA. These
  extensions allow finer-grained control over system security. However, 
  SELinux also changes some default system behaviors, such as shared library 
  loading, that can be problematic to third party programs.

  If you receive the error message:
  "cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied"
  when launching Scilab, then your SELinux configuration is preventing Scilab
  from launching.

  To rectify this issue, you can either:
    * Change the default security context for Scilab by issuing the command:
      chcon -t texrel_shlib_t <scilab_path>/thirdparty/java/lib/i386/server/libjvm.so
      chcon -t texrel_shlib_t ~/flexdock/RubberBand.so
    * Disabling SELinux altogether by setting the line
      SELINUX=disabled
      in your /etc/sysconfig/selinux file.

  For more information about SELinux, please consult your Linux distribution
  vendor.



Scilab 4.0 Release_Notes
***************************

- Next to the on line help of the software, we advise you, to make
the first move with Scilab, to consult the Scilab step-to-step web site
(http://www.spas.cnrs-gif.fr/index.html).

- Please note that:
    - Scilab 4.x versions family will be the last versions working
with the old graphics mode.
    - Scilab v 4.0 is the last release working with Microsoft
Windows 98 and Microsoft Visual 6.0 (compilation, not incremental link)
supported by Scilab operational team.

- Scilab binary versions are built:
    - for Linux: gcc-3.4.3 and g77 compilers with a platform under
Mandriva 2005. No need to recompile except to use incremental link, we
advise indeed to download the source files if you are using others
compilers.
    - for Windows: Visual Studio .Net 2003 and Fortran and C Intel
compilers with a platform under Windows XP Service Pack 2 .
    - Recall: No Scilab GTK version is provided and supported by
the operational team. Same way about MinGW and Cygwin.
