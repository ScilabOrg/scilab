Scilab 4.1 Release Notes
************************

- Next to the on line help of the software, we advise you, to make
the first move with Scilab, to consult the Scilab step-to-step web site
(http://www.spas.cnrs-gif.fr/index.html).


- Please note that:
    - Scilab 4.x versions family will be the last versions working
with the old graphics mode.
    - Scilab v 4.0 was the last release working with Microsoft
Windows 98 and Microsoft Visual 6.0 (compilation, not incremental link)
supported by Scilab operational team.
    - genlib() will not accept anymore that there is not an "endfunction"
at the end of each scilab function. Please, be sure that you have this 
keyword at the end of your function.


- Scilab binary versions are built:
    - for Linux: gcc-3.4.3 and g77 compilers with a platform under
Mandriva 2005. No need to recompile except to use incremental link, we
advise indeed to download the source files if you are using others
compilers.
    - for Windows: Visual Studio .Net 2003 and Fortran and C Intel
compilers with a platform under Windows XP Service Pack 2 .
    - Recall: No Scilab GTK version is provided and supported by
the operational team. Same way about MinGW and Cygwin.


- Under linux platforms :
    - Using xclick() or xgetmouse() functions, be sure your "num lock"
is disabled if you want to catch keypad evenements.
    - We advise to download and build scilab source version if you want
to compile SCI/examples/callsci directory.
