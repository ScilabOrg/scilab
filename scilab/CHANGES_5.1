               Changes between version 5.0.X and 5.1 of Scilab
               ===============================================

Tests:
======

* Tests added for functions: umf_luget, taucs_chget, pcg, removedir, rmdir, ones
* Added elementary functions: acosd acoth asecd asech asec asind
                       atand cosd cotd cscd csc secd sech sec sind tand 

Compilation:
============

* libmatio is now detected thanks to pkg-config

* More warnings in C/C++/Fortran during the compilation process.
See http://lists.scilab.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-browse?list=dev&cmd=showmsg&msgnum=684

* --enable-build-help is now the default behaviour (--disable-build-help removes the check of the dependencies)

* interpolation, signal_processing, statistics modules are loaded dynamically by scilab.

* cc and cc-* are not longer consider as GNU C compiler when detecting the compiler (use gcc & gcc-*) because it was causing some issues under Solaris

* By default, under Linux/Unix/Macosx, static libraries are no longer built.

Enhancement:
============

* Update of some output strings (standard, warning & error)

* Update of the example in the dynamic_link modules and in the toolbox skeleton (use the actual filename instead of the .o)

* Scilab uses Atlas 3.9.4 on Windows

* test_run() now accepts absolute paths as first input argument. It permits toolboxes to use this system.

* Directive FRENCH IMPOSED added to test_run() to force the test in french

* New function dae (for Differential Algebraic Equations) added.
This function is providing the same features as dassl with ode (ordinary differential equations) profile.
For more information, see SEP #2.

* Request 564 : completion add '\' or '/' at the end of a directory

* Errors occuring when getting or setting graphic/gui handles properties are now teated as any other Scilab errors.

* Now catch the exception when JOGL is crashing because native library gluegen-rt is not available in the java.library.path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH) and display a nice message

Internationalization:
=====================

* Almost all the i/o functions (isdir, mkdir, cd, chdir, mopen, fileinfo, 
mclose, deletefile, findfiles, ls, listfiles, getshortpathname, 
getlongpathname, removedir...) now handle file and directory names containing
UTF-8 characters. This is the work of Yung-Jang Lee. Many thanks!
(Unitary tests provided)
