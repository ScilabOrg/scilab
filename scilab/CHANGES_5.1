               Changes between version 5.0.X and 5.1 of Scilab
               ===============================================


Version 5.0.1 begins at rev. 27555.
Version 5.0.2 begins at rev. ?????.

Tests:
======

* Tests added for functions: umf_luget, taucs_chget, pcg, removedir, rmdir, ones


Compilation:
============

* libmatio is now detected thanks to pkg-config

* More warnings in C/C++/Fortran during the compilation process.
See http://lists.scilab.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-browse?list=dev&cmd=showmsg&msgnum=684

* interpolation, signal_processing, statistics modules are loaded dynamically by scilab.

Enhancement:
============

* Scilab 5.1 uses GIWS 1.0

* Update of some output strings (standard, warning & error)

* Update of the example in the dynamic_link modules and in the toolbox skeleton (use the actual filename instead of the .o)

* Scilab uses Atlas 3.8.2 on Windows

* License changed to Public Domain for most of the examples (especially the toolbox skeleton and the examples in the dynamic link module)

* test_run() now accepts absolute paths as first input argument. It permits toolboxes to use this system.
