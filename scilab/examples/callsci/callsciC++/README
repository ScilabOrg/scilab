	from a C++ program
	
In this directory we provide small examples of C++ calls to the Scilab 
interpreter.

[1] Unix ( soure are myprog.c and ccmatrix1.cc )
To make it run you have to edit the Makefile 
and change the SCIDIR variable to fit your local Scilab installation 

Then type 
	make distclean 
	make all
	./myprog

[2] Windows (soure are myprog.c and ccmatrix1.cpp )
	nmake /f Makefile.mak all /a
	
	You have to set SCI to the Scilab directory 
	set SCI=c:\program files\scilab-4.1
	then run prog.exe in a console
	to make the program run
	..\..\..\bin\prog.exe
