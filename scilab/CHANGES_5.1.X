               Changes between version 5.1.0 and 5.1.1 of Scilab
               =================================================


Improvements:
=============

* Catalan localization added (Thanks Oriol Gonzalez and others)

* German Localization added (Thanks Armin Mohring and others)

* Spanish Localization added (Thanks Federico Vera and others)

* Online Help translated into portuguÃªs do Brasil (pt_BR) added
  (Thanks Daniel de Souza Grilo)


Compilation:
============

* Defining the environment variable SCI_JAVA_ENABLE_HEADLESS disables the X11
  access when building the documentation (necessary when building the
  documentation in a chroot)

* ./configure && make all && make distclean == tarball (ie, make distclean is
  cleaning all the elements)

* In the source tree of Scilab, ant target "build-example" added in order to
  build only the javasci examples (cd modules/javasci && ant build-example)

Source reorganisation:
======================

* New module added call_scilab: the goal of this module is to highlight the
  possibility to call Scilab engine from other languages.

* "SCI/modules/output_stream/includes/error.h" renamed to "do_error_number.h"

Help & Tests:
=============

* Some equations in the documentation converted to the MathML format
  (bugs #4180 & #4182)

* Page "Compile and run with Javasci" added

* Examples in javasci translated into english

* Examples and unit tests added for the function find

* Examples provided in the help of the function argn

* Unit tests for the completion (GUI & NW/NWNI modes)

* Minor improvements in the documentation of the ilib_* functions and
  fprintf

* Unitary tests for isfield() function has been added


Enhancement:
============

* isfield() now accepts matrix of strings (fieldnames) as second input argument.
  Then, it returns a matrix of booleans.

* test_run() now accepts "skip_tests" as optionnal argument (3rd argument), if
  present, the second input argument of test_run is no more the list of tests to
  launch but the list of tests to skip.
  For example, test_run("time",["bug_1506" "bug_793"],"skip_tests");

* test_run() : The following tags have been added :
  - <-- WINDOWS ONLY --> If the operating system isn't Windows, the test is skipped.
  - <-- UNIX ONLY -->    If the operating system isn't an unix OS, the test is skipped.
  - <-- LINUX ONLY -->   If the operating system isn't Linux, the test is skipped.
  - <-- MACOSX ONLY -->  If the operating system isn't MacOSX, the test is skipped.

License:
========

* Examples in SCI/modules/javasci/examples/ are now released under the public
  domain


Internal API:
=============

* GetLengthStringMatrixByName function added in stack3.h (return length of strings)

Tests:
======

* Tests added for functions: umf_luget, taucs_chget, pcg, removedir, rmdir, ones

Internationalization:
=====================

* Almost all the i/o functions (isdir, mkdir, cd, chdir, mopen, fileinfo,
mclose, deletefile, findfiles, ls, listfiles, getshortpathname,
getlongpathname, removedir...) now handle file and directory names containing
UTF-8 characters. This is the work of Yung-Jang Lee. Many thanks!
(Unitary tests provided)

Misc:
=====

* Some dead code removed (SCI/scripts/,
                          SCI/bin/{dold,scilink,Blatdoc,Blatdocs,f77-linux,minfopr} )


Compilation:

See http://lists.scilab.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-browse?list=dev&cmd=showmsg&msgnum=684

* --enable-build-help is now the default behaviour
  (--disable-build-help removes the check of the dependencies)

  (--without-fftw, --without-pvm and --without-umfpack removes their builds)

* interpolation, signal_processing, statistics modules are loaded dynamically
  by Scilab.

* cc and cc-* are not longer consider as GNU C compiler when detecting the
  compiler (use gcc & gcc-*) because it was causing some issues under Solaris

* By default, under Linux/Unix/Macosx, static libraries are no longer built.

* Do not init TK when building the doc ("make doc")... in order to be able to
build Scilab through ssh

* Giws has lost it .py extension

* Force the build for the french documentation.
