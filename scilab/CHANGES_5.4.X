            Changes between version 5.3.3 and 5.4.0 of Scilab
            =================================================


Scilab Desktop:
===============

* Thanks to this new feature, Scilab confirms its usuability and its strong
user-oriented approach. Scilab Desktop is the new concept behind Scilab
window management taking advantage of advanced Flexdock features.
Out of the box, Scilab is now able to save all windows layouts including the
help browser, the variable browser, the command history, Scinotes and Xcos.
Through this major improvement, position and size of all the windows will
be preserved from a session to an other.

In this context, a file browser component has been developped and fully
integrated in Scilab Desktop and all other components have been improved
to provide the best user experience for Scilab's users.

Scilab Desktop provides various predefined layouts:
 - Simple      The standard Scilab console
               => Scilab 5.3.3 (and previous versions) defaults.
 - Integrated  The variable browser, the history browser and the file browser
               the console are opened by default and combined around Scilab's
               Console to provide an ergonomic working environment
               => Scilab 5.4.0 defaults


XML features:
=============

* Version 5.4.0 introduces XML management features. It allows easy access to
XML files, validation and writing.

 - XMLObjects - Describe the properties of the different XML objects
 - xmlAddNs - Add a namespace to a XML Element
 - xmlClose - Close a XML document
 - xmlDTD - Create a XML DTD object
 - xmlDocument - Create a new XML document
 - xmlDump - Dump a XML object
 - xmlElement - Create a new XML element
 - xmlFormat - Format a Scilab variable into XML
 - xmlGetNsByHref - Get a namespace by its href
 - xmlGetNsByPrefix - Get a namespace by prefix
 - xmlGetOpenStreams - Get all open XML documents or all open XML Validation files.
 - xmlNs - Create a new XML Namespace
 - xmlRead - Read a XML stream from a local or distant file
 - xmlReadStr - Read a XML tree from a string
 - xmlRelaxNG - Create a XML Relax NG object
 - xmlSchema - Create a XML Schema object
 - xmlValidate - Validate a document in using a DTD, a Relax NG or a Schema.
 - xmlWrite - Write a XML document in a file
 - xmlXPath - Make an XPath query on a XML document
 - xmlIsValidObject - Test the existence of an XML object

These features have been developped in the context of the OASIS R&D project.

New functions
=============

* The assert module provides a set of assertion functions.
  The goal of this module is to provide functions to check the
  behavior of some other functions, for example in unit tests.
  We emphasize the use of consistent tools for testing numerical
  issues, with the goal of testing numerical algorithms more easily.
  In particular, we provide a comparison function for two floating
  point numbers, which allows to check that two numbers are
  "numerically almost equal", i.e. that the relative error is small.
  This automatically fixes the bug #4381.

* The damp function in CACSD modules computes the natural pulsation
  and damping factor of linear dynamical systems.

Performance:
============

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, Scilab startup speed of scilab-cli and
  scilab-adv-cli have been improved by 15 to 20 % (see Compilation for more
  information).

* SSE is now enabled by default under GNU/Linux with 32 bit CPU (it is already
  the case under 64 bit CPU).
  Pentium III class (or equivalent) with SSE instructions is required.

Compilation:
============

* Under Windows, Scilab uses VS 2010 Pro and Express solution.

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, engine libraries have been merged into a single
  libraries named libscilab-cli.so. This greatly improves the startup
  performances.
  Note that the --enable-maintainer-mode enables the previous behavior (simply
  the development process).

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, all modules build as standalone its algorithms
  as a static library (only available in the source tree).
  This will avoid an important dependency tree for unitary testing.

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, for each module, get ride of the list of
  the explicit dependencies on the other libraries. Use libscilab-cli.so or
  libscilab.so to link against Scilab.

* Enforce a minimal version of JRosetta (1.0.4).

* Enforce a minimal version of flexdock (1.0).

* Enforce a minimal version of GIWS (1.3.0).

* Force the Java class version target to version 6 (or 1.6).

* Add Java 7 in the Debian & Ubuntu search path under GNU/Linux.

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, if ccache is installed, use it to build Scilab.

* bug 9409 fixed - warning "remark #8291" removed with Intel Fortran 2011 compiler.

* bug 9500 fixed - Explicit the GUI module manifest class-path to make Debian
                   checking tool happy.

* bug 9782 fixed - configure with --without-gui was failing.

                   release mode on Windows.

Variable browser:
=================

* Automatically resize the variable browser table when docked.

* A tooltip has been added on the type column to display the name of the type.

* A tooltip has been added on the size column to display the size in Bytes
  (like in previous version of Scilab).


History:
========

Known issues
============

* Some issues on startup under Mac OS X 10.6.7 (and previous 10.6 versions)
  have been reported.
  If you have "Audio Hijack" installed on your Mac OS X, it prevents some
  applications to work including Scilab. See bug #7012.
  Uninstall / disable Audio Hijack should fix this problem.
  Airfoil, also developed by Rogue Amoeba, has been reported as also breaking
  Scilab.
