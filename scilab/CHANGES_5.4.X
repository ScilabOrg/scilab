            Changes between version 5.4.0-alpha-1 and 5.4.0-beta-1 of Scilab
            ================================================================


Graphics
========

* Entire refactoring of Scilab graphic capabilities in order to solve the known issues
  of graphical cards compatibilities and many Scilab crashes.

* Based on SciRenderer (rendering library based on JoGL), Scilab graphics have
  been rewritten to provide new graphic functionalities with:
  - better performances,
  - better stability,
  - 2-D zoom using the mouse wheel,
  - new 3-D zoom capabilities,
  - rotation available through the mouse right-click.
  SciRenderer is a free and open-source library developed by Scilab Enterprises
  for 2-D and 3-D rendering of scientific data.

* Improved graphic exports:
  - Off-screen export (Scilab will not open a window to export with driver).
  - New bitmap formats supported: PNG, JPEG and BMP in the driver function.
  - New vectorial formats supported: PDF and SVG in the driver function.
  - Many portability issues fixed.


* Bug #4289 fixed - Graphic exports were not working when the drawlater or the
                    pixmap modes were activated.

* Bug #4339 fixed - listvarinfile did not manage graphic handles.

* Bug #4818 fixed - Scilab could not export graphics which contained a lot of information.

* Bug #6582 fixed - A copy of a handle did not keep foreground property.

* Bug #6644 fixed - New graphic windows take care of default figure properties (uimenu).

* Bug #7998 fixed - %h_get failed on heterogeneous handle matrix.

* Bug #8241 fixed - Graphical properties were not always inherited.

* Bug #8250, #10567, #10614 fixed - Artefacts dropped on the
                                    vectorial (EPS/PDF/SVG) exports.

* Bug #8705 fixed - Some specific graphics could not be saved.

* Bug #8916 fixed - Menu to export in PS format was missing in graphic figures.

* Bug #9721 fixed - Documentation improved on tight_limits. Thanks to Samuel
                    Gougeon.

* Bug #10240 fixed - In a Scilab localized in French, SVG export could use "," instead
                     of "." for numerical separator.

* Bug #10290 fixed - Error message for bad assignement of interp_color_vector updated.

* Bug #10360 fixed - Default format for export is now PNG instead of BMP.

* Bug #10365 fixed - To copy a handle to a figure (instead of an axes) crashed Scilab.

* Bug #10395 fixed - xset("clipping", [1,2,3,4]) returned an error.

* Bug #10417 fixed - xget("background") returned a wrong value.

* Bug #10637 fixed - xs2svg crashed when first input argument was not a figure handle.
                     An error message is now displayed.


GUI
===

* A 'Console' handle has been created and can be obtained by calling get(0):
  - uimenus now appear as 'Children' of this handle when they are added to the
    console,
  - the 'ShowHiddenHandles' property enables the user to make some hidden
    graphic objects visible.

* Scilab Console and graphic figure menus are now uimenus. They are hidden by
  default. To see them in the children list, use set(get(0), "ShowHiddenHandles", "on")

* New uicontrols added:
  - 'image' style uicontrol: display, transformation and various other
    operations on images.
  - 'table' style uicontrol: display data in a table form (read-only in Scilab
    5.4.0-BETA-1 version).

* The 'Value' property can now contain non-integer values and allows to take full
  advantage of 'slider' style uicontrols (See bug #7380).

* Figure resizing can now be managed by the user (uicontrol position setting, ...)
  through the 'resizefcn' property.


Scilab
======

* save/load functions can export/import Scilab data to SOD format:
 - Scilab data are saved and loaded using a standard, HDF5-based, documented,
   and fully tested: Scilab Open Data format (SOD).
 - Graphic handles can be saved under the SOD format.
 - 'save' writes data to HDF5 format when using new calling sequence
   save("filename.sod", "a", "b", "c"). This format is Scilab 6 compatible.
 - 'save' displays a message when using old calling sequence
   save("filename", a, b, c) and writes data in old Scilab binary format.
   This format will not be supported by Scilab 6.
 - The 'matfile2sci' function now converts MAT-files to SOD files.

* Calling load with a file descriptor as first input argument is now obsolete.
  Please replace the file descriptor by the corresponding file name.
  This feature will be removed in Scilab 6.0.0

* Update the default size of the Scilab stack to 100 million elements (instead of
  50M). See stacksize help page for more information.

* Scilab Desktop provides a button in dockbar to get the help about the component.

* External modules are managed out of the box by test_run function. See bug #9834.
Example: test_run('SCI/contrib/toolbox_skeleton')


XML
===

* xmlClose renamed in xmlDelete and xmlGetOpenStreams in xmlGetOpenDocs.

* Bug #10185 fixed - Add xmlDelete("all") in xml.quit.

* Bug #10594 fixed - size could not be used with two arguments on XMLList.

* Bug #10630 fixed - Typo fixed in an error message.

            Changes between version 5.3.3 and 5.4.0-alpha-1 of Scilab
            =========================================================

Scilab Desktop
===============

* Thanks to this new feature, Scilab confirms its usability and its strong
user-oriented approach. Scilab desktop is the new concept behind Scilab
windows management taking advantage of our docking system (advanced Flexdock features).
Out of the box, Scilab is now able to save all windows layouts including the
help browser, the variable browser, the command history, SciNotes and Xcos.
Through this major improvement, position and size of all windows will
be saved from a session to another.

In this context, a file browser component has been developed and fully
integrated into Scilab desktop and all other components have been improved
to provide the best user experience for Scilab users.

Editvar has had important refreshment. It allows plot and subplot, manages
almost all Scilab variable types and is much more faster.

Scilab desktop provides various predefined layouts:
 - Simple      The standard Scilab console
               => Scilab 5.3.3 (and previous versions) defaults.
 - Integrated  The variable browser, the history browser and the file browser
               are opened by default and combined around Scilab
               console to provide an ergonomic workspace
               => Scilab 5.4.0 defaults


XML Features
=============

* Version 5.4.0 introduces XML management features. It allows easy access to
XML files, validation and writing.

 - XMLObjects - Describe the properties of the different XML objects
 - xmlAddNs - Add a namespace to a XML Element
 - xmlClose - Close a XML document
 - xmlDTD - Create a XML DTD object
 - xmlDocument - Create a new XML document
 - xmlDump - Dump a XML object
 - xmlElement - Create a new XML element
 - xmlFormat - Format a Scilab variable into XML
 - xmlGetNsByHref - Get a namespace by its href
 - xmlGetNsByPrefix - Get a namespace by prefix
 - xmlGetOpenStreams - Get all open XML documents or all open XML Validation files.
 - xmlNs - Create a new XML Namespace
 - xmlRead - Read a XML stream from a local or distant file
 - xmlReadStr - Read a XML tree from a string
 - xmlRelaxNG - Create a XML Relax NG object
 - xmlSchema - Create a XML Schema object
 - xmlValidate - Validate a document in using a DTD, a Relax NG or a Schema.
 - xmlWrite - Write a XML document in a file
 - xmlXPath - Make an XPath query on a XML document
 - xmlIsValidObject - Test the existence of a XML object

Those features have been developed in the context of the OASIS R&D project.

New Functions
=============

* The assert module provides a set of assertion functions.
  The goal of this module is to provide functions to check the
  behavior of some other functions, for example in unitary tests.
  We emphasize the use of consistent tools for testing numerical
  issues, with the goal of testing numerical algorithms more easily.
  In particular, we provide a comparison function for two floating
  point numbers, which allows to check that two numbers are
  "numerically almost equal", i.e. that the relative error is small.
  This automatically fixes Bug #4381.

* The damp function in CACSD module computes the natural pulsation
  and damping factor of linear dynamical systems.


Optimization

   removed in Scilab 5.4.1.

* 'showalluimenushandles' function (graphics) was undocumented. This function is
  obsolete and will be removed on 5.4.
  Use set(get(0), "ShowHiddenHandles", "on"); instead.

* 'code2str' and 'str2code' are obsolete and will be removed on 5.4.1, please use
  'ascii' instead.


Removed Functions (previously declared as obsolete)

Performance
============

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, Scilab start-up speed of scilab-cli and
  scilab-adv-cli has been improved by 15 to 20 % (see Compilation for more
  information).

* SSE is now enabled by default under GNU/Linux with 32-bit CPU (it is already
  the case under 64-bit CPU).
  Pentium III class (or equivalent) with SSE instructions is required.

* Improved performances of function pareto_filter (Genetic algorithms).

* Bug #8608 fixed - dec2hex, hex2dec, dec2oct, oct2dec, base2dec code have been
                   simplified and optimized.


Compilation
============

* Under Windows, Scilab uses VS 2010 Pro and Express solution.

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, engine libraries have been merged into a single
  library named libscilab-cli.so. This greatly improves the start-up
  performances.
  Note that the --enable-maintainer-mode enables the previous behavior (simply
  the development process).

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, all modules build as standalone their algorithms
  as a static library (only available in the source tree).
  This will avoid an important dependency tree for unitary testing.

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, for each module, the list of
  explicit dependencies on the other libraries is no more needed.
  Use libscilab-cli.so or libscilab.so to link against Scilab.

* Enforce a minimal version of JRosetta (1.0.4).

* Enforce a minimal version of flexdock (1.0).

* Enforce a minimal version of GIWS (1.3.0).

* Force the Java class version target to version 6 (or 1.6).

* Add Java 7 in the Debian & Ubuntu search path under GNU/Linux.

* Under GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, if ccache is installed, use it to build Scilab.

* Bug #9409 fixed - Warning "remark #8291" removed with Intel Fortran 2011 compiler.

* Bug #9500 fixed - Explicit the GUI module manifest class-path to facilitate Debian
                   checking tool process.

* Bug #9782 fixed - configure with --without-gui was failing.

* Bug #9793 fixed - --without-gui now also disables Xcos.

* Bug #9883 fixed - Build with --disable-build-help was failing.

* Bug #9991 fixed - ./configure --without-xcos failed to build.

* Bug #10158 fixed - Configure used g77 even if gfortran was available.


Dynamic Link
=============

* Bug #9432 fixed - Link a 64-bit dynamic library on a 32-bit platform returned
                   a wrong error message under Windows.

* Bug #9761 fixed - NDEBUG was not defined for dynamic link (by default) in
                   release mode under Windows.

* Bug #9930 fixed - ilib_build did not display all filenames used.

* Bug #10320 fixed - libname argument of ilib_for_link did not work.

* Bug #10344 fixed - Windows SDK 7.1 was not detected with VS Express 2010
                    under 64-bit platform.


Variable Browser
=================

* Shows the dimension of the variable by default.

* Automatically resize the variable browser table when docked.

* A tooltip has been added on the type column to display the name of the type.

* A tooltip has been added on the size column to display the size in bytes
  (like in previous versions of Scilab).


History
========

* Default text in history for a starting session has been changed for:
"Begin Session: Tue Jun 21 14:35:45 2011" to "21/06/2011 14:35:45"


Graphics
=========

* Obsolete value for line_style property:
  0 and 1 are equivalent values for SOLID rendering.
  A warning message will be displayed if the user tries to set this property to 0.
  Setting this property to 0 will no more be supported in Scilab 5.4.1.

* getcallbackobject: Input argument must be an UID (String) and no more an index (Constant).

* datatips tool improved on several aspects:
  - It is now possible to manage directional arrows as well as
    square mark markers.
  - The automatic label placement has been improved to avoid the
    overlapping with the curve.
  - It is now possible to have painted box or box free labels.
  - Markers can now be selected and moved using the arrow keys
    or deleted with the "Del" key.

Known Issues
============
* Random crash under Mac OS X at start-up.
  Some random crash can occur at first Scilab start-up. Try to restart Scilab.

* Some issues at start-up under Mac OS X 10.6.7 (and previous 10.6 versions)
  have been reported.
  If you have "Audio Hijack" installed on your Mac OS X, it prevents some
  applications to work including Scilab. See Bug #7012.
  Uninstall / disable Audio Hijack should fix this problem.
  Airfoil, also developed by Rogue Amoeba, has been reported as also breaking
  Scilab.
