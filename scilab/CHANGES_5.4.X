Localization:
=============

* Czech localization by ZbynÄ›k Schwarz


File input/output:
==================

* mgetl, exec, fscanfMat functions manage files encoded as UTF-8 with BOM.

* tempname function added (SEP 68).


New functions
=============

* The assert module provides a set of assertion functions.
  The goal of this module is to provide functions to check the
  behavior of some other functions, for example in unit tests.
  We emphasize the use of consistent tools for testing numerical
  issues, with the goal of testing numerical algorithms more easily.
  In particular, we provide a comparison function for two floating
  point numbers, which allows to check that two numbers are
  "numerically almost equal", i.e. that the relative error is small.
  This automatically fixes the bug #4381.

* The damp function in CACSD modules computes the natural pulsation
  and damping factor of linear dynamical systems.

Optimization:
=============

* neldermead: Added a demo - search for largest smallest polygon.

* Improved clarity of examples in the help pages of the
  optimization module.
  Avoid unnecessary calls to "deff".
  Avoid the "all statements in whole line" style.

* bug 7891 fixed - The neldermead component had too many options.
  Tagged -costfargument option of optimbase as obsolete: will be
  maintained for backward compatibility until 5.4.1.
  The -fun option can now be a list, where the element #1 is a
  function, and the elements #2 to the end are automatically appended to
  the calling sequence.
  Tagged -outputcommandarg option of optimbase as obsolete: will be
  maintained for backward compatibility until 5.4.1.
  The -outputcommand option can now be a list, where the element #1 is
  a function, and the elements #2 to the end are automatically appended
  to the calling sequence.
  Tagged "outputfun(x,optimValues,state)" calling sequence of fminsearch
  as obsolete: will be maintained for backward compatibility until
  5.4.1.
  The new calling sequence is "stop=outputfun(x,optimValues,state)"
  Tagged "myoutputfun(state,data)" calling sequence of neldermead
  as obsolete: will be maintained for backward compatibility until
  5.4.1.
  The new calling sequence is "stop=myoutputfun(state,data)"
  Tagged "-myterminateflag" and "-myterminate" options as obsolete:
  will be maintained for backward compatibility until 5.4.1.
  See the help page of neldermead for details to update your
  code, if required.

  tolrelativevariance options of neldermead are now obsolete.
  See the help page of neldermead for details to update your
  code, if required.
