Event Handling Functions:
=========================
 - All the event hadling functions "xclick", "xgetmouse" and the "envent_handler"
       * they have been rewritten in Java

         (previously "xclick" and "xgetmouse" used "-100" code) 
 - Obsolete functions:
       * Using xgetmouse with a flag to avoid the event queue to be cleared is now obsolete. This functionnality will be removed in Scilab 5.1.

  - Integration of the ATLAS library (specific Windows version).
    During the installation of Scilab, dynamic library (Atlas.dll) is 
    automatically chosen according to the CPU detected.
    See details in the Atlas.spec file under scilab\bin directory.
    
    Scilab can be used with Atlas library on all platforms by:
    
    + downloading Atlas library sources.
    + compiling Atlas sources.
    + compiling scilab sources with the following configure option : 
         --with-atlas-library=ATLAS_LIB_DIRECTORY
         
      (see <SCI>/configure --help).
    
  - Java interface written to allow calling Scilab computational engine from Java.

  - Font rotation is now possible under Xwindow.

  - SCI and HOME are redefined if not correct ( Bug 1488 Only for Windows ).

  - HOME variable (%HOME%) defined under Windows: c:/Documents and Setting/USER.

  - New environment variable SCIHOME:
    + Under Windows: %HOME%\scilab\SCILAB_VERSION
    + Under Linux: $HOME/USER/.scilab/SCILAB_VERSION

  - Function what() has been rewritten : alphabetical sort, print modified.

  - mkdir, rmdir, copyfile, toprint functions added for handling files and
    directories from Scilab.

  - getshortpathname, getlongpathname, winqueryreg (Registers), console, 
    mcisendstring (MCI device), clipboard, functions added for a better 
    interaction with Windows environment.

  - getos, setenv, getmemory, sleep, functions added for a better interaction 
    with the operating system (Unix and Windows).

  - The perl function as been added to allow execution of Perl scripts from 
    Scilab.

  - The calendar function has been added.

Please note:
============

  - "xgetmouse", "eventhandler" event set extended to click, double-click, <Ctrl> Key. 
    See more details in xclick and xgetmouse on line help.
    Warning: Because of distinction of click events, some users' scripts can 
    have a different behavior.
    To make it work as before please check and modified test on events as follow:
    supposing that button contains the value returned by xclick (left most argument) 
    or xgetmouse (third componant of returned vector) then replace test like:
      button==0 by or(button==[0,3])
      button==1 by or(button==[1,4])
      button==2 by or(button==[2,5])

		     ================================

NEW FUNCTIONALITIES
===================
Global variables have been introduced

Keyboard events and window closing within graphical windows can now be
captured.

Scicos graphical user interface has been made more intuitive and

Scilab Binary files created by "save" are now system-independent so
they can be exchanged. In particular (compiled macros) *.bin files and
*.cos (scicos diagrams) can be exchanged.

It is now possible to dynamically link C++ procedures with Scilab.

A new data type "mlist" has been added.

A new function "genlib" allows users to compile the .sci files in a
given directory, generate associated library and load it. This
function is particularly useful under windows if VC++ is not
available. 

C formatted input output functions (printf, scanf, ..) have been
interfaced to scilab.

OTHERS IMPROVEMENTS
===================
Efficiency has been improved using reference argument passing when
possible instead of value passing.

Hypermatrix opreations have been accelerated.

On X Window systems 3D Athena Widgets are preferably used instead of
standard  Athena Widgets for a better look.

The "Matlab 4" to Scilab translator has been completed and considerably
improved.



NEW TOOLBOXES
=============
True integer data types (1,2 and 4 bytes) with associated operations
and some functions acting on them have been added. 

A library of procedures has been added to allow the use of Matlab
mex-files under Scilab.

PORTS
=====

environment.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================
New Scilab "save"d files cannot be loaded by earlier Scilab versions.
A new function "oldsave" has been added to save in old format.

Scilab help mechanism has changed. The $MANCHAPTERS/Chapter is no more
used, instead a Scilab variable "helps" is used.





		     Main Changes Scilab 2.4 -> 2.4.1
		     ================================

Many bugs fixed.

Option "--without-pvm" added to configure to compile Scilab 
  without PVM library.

NEW MACHINES
============

Scilab runs now on MAC Mklinux and DEC Alpha Linux.

NEW FUNCTIONALITIES
===================

The Matlab to Scilab translator has been considerably improved.

After fixing a number of bugs, Scicos is no longer considered a beta release.

Metanet toolbox: Function "netclose" for closing a Metanet window 
                 has been added.

                     Main Changes Scilab 2.3 -> 2.4
                     ==============================

Fraclab: fractal and wavelet analysis.

Tksci: beta Tcl/Tk interface.

PVM: beta PVM interface (not yet available on Windows).

dcd: cumulative distribution functions and inverses...

grand: random number generators.

===================

Metanet toolbox: Function "pipe_network" for solving the pipe network problem 
                 has been added.

                - Faster Compiler 
                - Improved GUI

Maple toolbox: The Maple to Scilab interface (maple/maple2scilab.mpl)
               has been improved. Sparse matrices are handled. There is
               now the choice between C and Fortran code generation.

Nonlinear toolbox: Addition of 2D and 3D definite integrals int2d et int3d.

Data types: N dimensional arrays have been introduced (see hypermatrices).

chdir and getcwd functions added to change and get working directory.

Floating points exception handling may be set by "ieee" function.

Overloading: It is now possible to overload display of tlist data
             structure. It is also possible to extend basic primitive
             function definition to new data types. To avoid possible
             ambiguity overloading function names have been
             changed. Old names still work, but for efficiency it
             desirable to change it. See overloading help.

Syntax: Functions with strings arguments may be called as commands.
        For instance "exec('foo.sce')" can be entered as "exec foo.sce".

        It is now possible to define functions with unbounded number
        of input and output arguments (see varargin help).

INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

Some old Scicos diagrams may not be translated properly into Scilab 2.4.
