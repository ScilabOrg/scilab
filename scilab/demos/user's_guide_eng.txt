User's guide : how to create a demonstration

your demonstrations shall be written according to a precise principle : the main file does only contain
the standard functions at your disposal in the repository 'SCI_demos/demos_lib'as well as their call.
The scripts that are between these standard function will be called by the standard function demo_run(fil)
and be written in an annex .sce file. Allthe rest of the demonstration will apppearin the annex files, par-
ticularlythe functions, that will be written in .sci files.
The interest is that the developer of the SCILAB logiciel can thus modify as he want the shape of the de-
monstration without enter inside the script.
On another side, you are asked not to make appear the scripts or calculation on the console but rather
within the 'x_message' interface, obtained with demo_message.

	Here is a description of the functions written especially for the demonstration and available in
the repository SCI/demos/demos_lib : 
   The function demo_run allows you to execute the scripts you would have written on annex files.These
scripts will separate the other standard functions between themselves.
   The function demo_wp_begin can be used on the beginning of the demonstration. It sets the scripts in mode
of non display of the text, fixes the console width to its standard state while recording the previous width
in 'oldln', and gives the path of the file given in argument in the variable 'path' if the argument is not
'nofile'.
   The function demo_compiler is used as test to know if the reader of your demonstration's computer owns or
not a compiler C. It gives a boolean indicating this in the variable 'ans'.
   the function demo_message allows to display some messages, particularly calculations or explanations about
the demonstration.It take as argument a text in
