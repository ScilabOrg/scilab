In this chapter, we present Spendley, Hext and Himsworth algorithm \cite{Spendley1962} for 
unconstrained optimization.

We begin by presenting a global overview of the algorithm. 
Then we present various geometric situations which might occur
during the algorithm. In the second section, we present several 
numerical experiments which allow to get some insight in the behavior 
of the algorithm on some simple situations. The two first cases 
are involving only 2 variables and are based on a quadratic function.
The last numerical experiment explores the behavior of the algorithm 
when the number of variables increases.

\section{Introduction}

In this section, we present Spendley's et al algorithm for unconstrained optimization.
This algorithm is based on the iterative update of a simplex. 
At each iteration, either a reflection of a shrink step is performed, so that
the shape of the simplex does not change during the iterations.
Then we present various geometric situations which might occur
during the algorithm. This allows to understand when exactly a reflection 
or a shrink is performed in practice.

\subsection{Overview}

The goal of Spendley's et al. algorithm is to solve the 
following unconstrained optimization problem
\begin{eqnarray}
\min f(\bx)
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bx\in \RR^n$, $n$ is the number of optimization parameters and $f$ is the objective 
function $f:\RR^n\rightarrow \RR$.

This algorithms is based on the iterative update of 
a \emph{simplex} made of $n+1$ points $S=\{\bv_i\}_{i=1,n+1}$. Each point 
in the simplex is called a \emph{vertex} and is associated with 
a function value $f_i=f(\bv_i)$ for $i=1,n+1$.

The vertices are sorted by increasing function values so that the 
\emph{best} vertex has index 1 and the \emph{worst} vertex 
has index $n+1$
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{sp-sorted-vertices-fv}
f_1 \leq f_2 \leq \ldots \leq f_n \leq f_{n+1}.
\end{eqnarray}

The $\bv_1$ vertex (resp. the $\bv_{n+1}$ vertex) is called the \emph{best} 
vertex (resp. \emph{worst}), because it is associated with the lowest (resp. highest)
function value. As we are going to see, the \emph{next-to-worst} vertex $\bv_n$ has a 
special role in this algorithm.

The centroid of the simplex $\overline{\bx} (j)$ is the center of the vertices
where the vertex $\bv_j$ has been 
excluded. This centroid is 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{sp-centroid-generalized}
\overline{\bx} (j) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1,n+1, i\neq j} \bv_i.
\end{eqnarray}
The algorithm makes use
of one coefficient $\rho>0$, called the reflection factor. The standard
value of this coefficient is $\rho=1$.
The algorithm attempts to replace some vertex 
$\bv_j$ by a new vertex $\bx(\rho,j)$ on the line from the vertex $\bv_j$
to the centroid  $\overline{\bx}(j)$. The new vertex $\bx(\rho,j)$ is defined by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{sp-interpolate-generalized}
\bx(\rho,j) = (1+\rho)\overline{\bx}(j) - \rho \bv_j.
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Algorithm}

In this section, we analyze Spendley's et al algorithm, which
is presented in figure \ref{algo-spendley}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Compute an initial simplex $S_0$
\STATE Sorts the vertices $S_0$ with increasing function values
\STATE $S\gets S_0$
\WHILE{$\sigma(S)>tol$}
  \STATE $\overline{x}\gets \overline{\bx}(n+1)$ \COMMENT{Compute the centroid}
  \STATE $\bx_r \gets \bx(\rho,n+1)$ \COMMENT{Reflect with respect to worst}
  \STATE $f_r \gets f(\bx_r)$ 
  \IF {$f_r<f_{n+1}$}
    \STATE Accept $\bx_r$
  \ELSE
    \STATE $\overline{x}\gets \overline{\bx}(n)$ \COMMENT{Compute the centroid}
    \STATE $\bx_r^\prime \gets \bx(\rho,n)$ \COMMENT{Reflect with respect to next-to-worst}
    \STATE $f_r^\prime \gets f(\bx_r^\prime)$ 
    \IF {$f_r^\prime<f_{n+1}$}
      \STATE Accept $\bx_r^\prime$
    \ELSE 
      \STATE Compute the vertices $\bv_i=\bv_1 + \sigma (\bv_i - \bv_1)$ for $i=2,n+1$ \COMMENT{Shrink}
      \STATE Compute $f_i = f(\bv_i)$ for $i=2,n+1$
    \ENDIF
  \ENDIF
  \STATE Sort the vertices of $S$ with increasing function values
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Spendley's et al. algorithm}
\label{algo-spendley}
\end{figure}

At each iteration, we compute the centroid 
$\overline{\bx} (n+1)$ where the worst vertex $\bv_{n+1}$ 
has been excluded. This centroid is 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{sp-centroid-worst}
\overline{\bx} (n+1) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1,n} \bv_i.
\end{eqnarray}
We perform a reflection with respect to the worst vertex $\bv_{n+1}$,
which creates the reflected point $\bx_r$ defined by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{sp-interpolate-worst}
\bx_r = \bx(\rho,n+1) = (1+\rho)\overline{\bx}(n+1) - \rho \bv_{n+1}
\end{eqnarray}

We then compute the function value of the reflected
point as $f_r=f(\bx_r)$. If the function value $f_r$ is better than the worst function
value $f_{n+1}$, i.e. if $f_r < f_{n+1}$, then the worst vertex $\bv_{n+1}$ is rejected from the 
simplex and the reflected point $\bx_r$ is accepted. If the reflection point 
does not improve the function value $f_{n+1}$, we consider the centroid 
$\overline{\bx} (n)$, i.e. the centroid where the next-to-worst vertex $\bv_n$ has been excluded.
We then consider the reflected point $\bx_r^\prime$, computed from the 
next-to-worst vertex $\bv_n$ and the centroid $\overline{\bx} (n)$. 
We compute the function value $f_r^\prime = f(\bx_r^\prime)$. If the function
value $f_r^\prime$ improves over the worst function value $f_{n+1}$, then 
the worst vertex $\bv_{n+1}$ is rejected from the simplex and the new reflection point 
$\bx_r^\prime$ is accepted.

At that point of the algorithm, neither the reflection with respect to 
$\bv_{n+1}$ nor the reflection with respect to $\bv_n$ were able to improve over 
the worst function value $f_{n+1}$.
Therefore, the algorithm shrinks the simplex toward the best vertex $\bv_1$.
That last step uses the shrink coefficient $0<\sigma<1$. The standard
value for this coefficient is $\sigma=\frac{1}{2}$.

\subsection{Geometric analysis}

The figure \ref{fig-spendley-moves} presents the various 
moves of the Spendley et al. algorithm. It is obvious from the 
picture that the algorithm explores a pattern which is 
entirely determined from the initial simplex.

In Spendley's et al. original paper, the authors use a regular 
simplex, where the edges all have the same length. In practice,
however, any non degenerate simplex can be used.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{spendleymethod/spendley-steps.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Spendley et al. simplex moves}
\label{fig-spendley-moves}
\end{figure}

The various situations in which these moves are performed are 
presented in figures \ref{fig-spendley-moves-reflect}, \ref{fig-spendley-moves-reflect2}
and \ref{fig-spendley-moves-shrink}.

The basic move is the reflection step, presented in figure 
\ref{fig-spendley-moves-reflect} and \ref{fig-spendley-moves-reflect2}. 
These two figures show that Spendley's et al.
algorithm is based on a discretization of the parameter space. 
The optimum is searched on that grid, which is based on regular simplices.
When no move is possible to improve the situation on that grid,
a shrink step is necessary, as presented in figure \ref{fig-spendley-moves-shrink}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{spendleymethod/spendley-steps-reflect.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Spendley et al. simplex moves -- Reflection with respect to highest point}
\label{fig-spendley-moves-reflect}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{spendleymethod/spendley-steps-reflect2.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Spendley et al. simplex moves -- Reflection with respect to next-to-highest point. 
It may happen that the next iteration is a shrink step.}
\label{fig-spendley-moves-reflect2}
\end{figure}

In the situation of figure \ref{fig-spendley-moves-shrink}, neither the 
reflection \#1 or reflection \#2 have improved the simplex. 
Diminishing the size of the simplex by performing a shrink step 
is the only possible move because the 
simplex has vertices which are located across the valley.
This allows to refine the discretization grid on which the 
optimum is searched.

\subsection{General features of the algorithm}

From the performance point of viewn when a reflection step is performed,
only 1 or 2 function evaluations are required. Instead, when a shrink
step is performed, there are $n$ function evaluations required. In practice,
reflection steps are performed when the simplex is away from the optimum.
When the simplex is closer to the optimum, or enters in a narrow valley, shrink
steps are used.

As stated in \cite{Singer:2009}, the main feature 
of Spendley's et al. algorithm is that the simplex can vary 
in size, but not in shape. As we are going to see in the numerical 
experiments, this leads to a slow convergence when a narrow 
valley is encountered. In that situation, the shrink
steps are required, which leads to a large number 
of iterations and function evaluations.

In fact, the Spendley's et al. algorithm is a pattern search 
algorithm \cite{Torczon98fromevolutionary}. This is a consequence 
of the fact that the search pattern used in the method is constant.
Therefore, the design never degenerates. 
As stated in \cite{Torczon98fromevolutionary}, "under very mild 
assumptions on $f$, these simple heuristics 
provide enough structure to guarantee global convergence.
This is not the case for the Nelder-Mead algorithm, which might
converge to non-stationnary points \cite{589109, hanNeumann2003, Han2000, Torczon89multi-directionalsearch}. 
In all cases, the difficulty is that a sequence of simplices produced
by the Nelder-Mead simplex method can come arbitrarily close to 
degeneracy.

\section{Numerical experiments}

In this section, we present some numerical experiments 
with Spendley's et al. algorithm.
The first numerical experiments involves one quadratic function
in 2 dimensions. The second experiment is based on a 
badly scaled quadratic in 2 dimension. In the third experiment,
we analyze the behavior of the algorithm with respect to the 
number of variables.

\subsection{Quadratic function}

The function we try to minimize is the following quadratic 
in 2 dimensions 
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x_1,x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1 x_2.
\end{eqnarray}

The stopping criteria is based on the relative size of the simplex 
with respect to the size of the initial simplex 
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_+(S) < tol \times \sigma_+(S_0).
\end{eqnarray}
The oriented length $\sigma_+(S)$ is defined by
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_+(S) = \max_{i=2,n+1} \|\bv_i - \bv_1\|_2
\end{eqnarray}
where $\|.\|_2$ is the euclidian norm defined by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\|\bx\|_2 = \sum_{i=1,n}x_i^2.
\end{eqnarray}
In this experiment, we use $tol=10^{-8}$ as the relative tolerance 
on simplex size.

The initial simplex is a regular simplex with length unity.

The following Scilab script performs the optimization.

\lstset{language=scilabscript}
\begin{lstlisting}
function y = quadratic (x)
  y = x(1)^2 + x(2)^2 - x(1) * x(2);
endfunction
nm = neldermead_new ();
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-numberofvariables",2);
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-function",quadratic);
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-x0",[2.0 2.0]');
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-maxiter",100);
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-maxfunevals",300);
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-tolxmethod","disabled");
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-tolsimplexizerelative",1.e-8);
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-simplex0method","spendley");
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-method","fixed");
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-verbose",1);
nm = neldermead_configure(nm,"-verbosetermination",0);
nm = neldermead_search(nm);
neldermead_display(nm);
nm = neldermead_destroy(nm);
\end{lstlisting}


The numerical results are presented in table \ref{fig-spendley-numexp1-table}.

\end{figure}

The various simplices generated during the iterations are 
presented in figure \ref{fig-spendley-numexp1-historysimplex}.
The method use reflections in the early iterations. Then there
is no possible improvement using reflections and shrinking is necessary.
That behavior is an illustration of the discretization which has already
been discussed.

\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig-spendley-numexp1-sigma} presents the history of the oriented
length of the simplex. The length is updated step by step, where each step 
corresponds to a shrink in the algorithm.

\end{figure}

The convergence is quite fast in this case, since less than 60 iterations
allow to get a function value lower than $10^{-15}$, as shown in 
figure \ref{fig-spendley-numexp1-logfopt}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Badly scaled quadratic function}

The function we try to minimize is the following quadratic 
in 2 dimensions 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{quadratic-sp-function2}
f(x_1,x_2) = a x_1^2 + x_2^2,
\end{eqnarray}
where $a>0$ is a chosen scaling parameter. 
The more $a$ is large, the more difficult the problem is 
to solve with the simplex algorithm.
Indeed, let us compute the Hessian matrix associated with the 
cost function. We have 
\begin{eqnarray}
\bH = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
2 a & 0 \\
0 & 2
\end{array}
\right).
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix 
are $2a$ and $2$, which are stricly 
positive if $a>0$. Hence, the cost function is stricly convex and 
there is only one global solution, that is $\bx^\star = (0,0,\ldots,0)^T$.
The ratio between these two eigenvalues is $a$. This leads 
to an elongated valley, which is extremely narrow when $a$ is large.

The stopping criteria is based on the relative size of the simplex 
with respect to the size of the initial simplex 
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_+(S) < tol \times \sigma_+(S_0).
\end{eqnarray}
In this experiment, we use $tol=10^{-8}$ as the relative tolerance 
on simplex size.

We set the maximum number of function evaluations to 400.
The initial simplex is a regular simplex with length unity.

The following Scilab script allows to perform the optimization.

\lstset{language=scilabscript}
\begin{lstlisting}
a = 100;
function y = quadratic (x)
  y = a * x(1)^2 + x(2)^2;
endfunction
nm = nmplot_new ();
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-numberofvariables",2);
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-function",quadratic);
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-x0",[10.0 10.0]');
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-maxiter",400);
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-maxfunevals",400);
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-tolxmethod","disabled");
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-tolsimplexizerelative",1.e-8);
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-simplex0method","spendley");
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-method","fixed");
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-verbose",1);
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-verbosetermination",0);
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-simplexfn","rosenbrock.fixed.history.simplex.txt");
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-fbarfn","rosenbrock.fixed.history.fbar.txt");
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-foptfn","rosenbrock.fixed.history.fopt.txt");
nm = nmplot_configure(nm,"-sigmafn","rosenbrock.fixed.history.sigma.txt");
nm = nmplot_search(nm);
nmplot_display(nm);
nm = nmplot_destroy(nm);
\end{lstlisting}


The numerical results are presented in table \ref{fig-spendley-numexp1-table},
where the experiment is presented for $a=100$. We can check that the 
number of function evaluations is equal to its maximum limit, even if the value of the 
function at optimum is very inaccurate ($f(\bx^\star) \approx 0.08$).

\end{figure}

The various simplices generated during the iterations are 
presented in figure \ref{fig-spendley-numexp2-historysimplex}.
The method use reflections in the early iterations. Then there
is no possible improvement using reflections, so that shrinking is necessary.
But the repeated shrink steps makes the simplex very small, leading to a large number of 
iterations. This is a limitation of the method, which is based on a simplex 
which can vary its size, but not its shape.

\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig-spendley-numexp2-scaling}, we analyze the 
behavior of the method with respect to scaling.
We check that the method behave poorly when the scaling is 
bad. The convergence speed is slower and slower and impractical 
when $a>10$

\subsection{Sensitivity to dimension}

In this section, we try to study the convergence of the 
Spendley et al. algorithm with respect to the number of variables,
as presented by Han \& Neumann in \cite{HanNeumann2006}.
We emphasize, though, that Han \& Neumann present their numerical 
experiment with the Nelder-Mead algorithm, while we present 
in this section the Spendley et al. algorithm.
The function we try to minimize is the following quadratic function 
in $n$-dimensions 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{quadratic-sp-function3}
f(\bx) = \sum_{i=1,n} x_i^2.
\end{eqnarray}

The initial guess is the origin $\bx_0 = (0,0,\ldots,0)^T$,
which is also the global solution of the problem.
We have $f(\bx_0)=0$ so that this vertex is never updated 
during the iterations.
The initial simplex is computed with a random number generator.
The first vertex of the initial simplex is the origin.
The other vertices are uniform in the $[-1,1]$ interval.
An absolute termination criteria on the size of the simplex is used, 
that is, the algorithm is stopped when the inequality 
$\sigma_+(S_k) \leq 10^{-8}$ is satisfied.

For this test, we compute the rate of convergence as presented
in Han \& Neuman \cite{HanNeumann2006}. This rate is defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{rho-sp-rate-convergence}
\rho(S_0,n) = \textrm{lim sup}_{k\rightarrow \infty} 
\left(\prod_{i=0,k-1} \frac{\sigma(S_{i+1})}{\sigma(S_i)}\right)^{1/k},
\end{eqnarray}
where $k$ is the number of iterations.
That definition can be viewed as the geometric mean of the ratio of the 
oriented lengths between successive simplices.
This definition implies 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{rho-sp-rate-convergence2}
\rho(S_0,n) = \textrm{lim sup}_{k\rightarrow \infty} 
\left(\frac{\sigma(S_k)}{\sigma(S_0)}\right)^{1/k},
\end{eqnarray}

If $k$ is the number of iterations required to obtain convergence, as 
indicated by the termination criteria, the rate of convergence is practically computed as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho(S_0,n,k) = \left( \frac{\sigma(S_{k})}{\sigma(S_0)}\right)^{1/k}.
\end{eqnarray}

The following Scilab script allows to perform the optimization.

The figure \ref{fig-sp-numexp3-nbsteps} presents the type of 
steps which are performed for each number of variables.
We see that the algorithm mostly performs shrink steps.

The figure \ref{fig-sp-numexp3-dimension} presents the number of function 
evaluations depending on the number of variables.
We can see that the number of function evaluations 
increases approximately linearly with the dimension of the problem in
figure \ref{fig-sp-numexp3-fvn}. A rough rule of thumb is that, for $n=1,20$, 
the number of function evaluations is equal to $30n$:
most iterations are shrink steps and approximately 30 iterations are required,
almost independently of $n$.

The table \ref{fig-sp-numexp3-dimension} also shows the interesting 
fact that the convergence rate is almost constant and 
very close to $1/2$. This is a consequence of the shrink steps,
which are dividing the size of the simplex at each iteration by 2.

\section{Conclusion}

We saw in the first numerical experiment that the method 
behave reasonably when the function is correctly scaled.
When the function is badly scaled, as in the second numerical 
experiment, the Spendley et al. algorithm produces a large 
number of function evaluations and converges very slowly.
This limitation occurs with even moderate badly scaled 
functions and generates a very slow method in these 
cases.

In the last experiment, we have explored what happens when the number of 
iterations is increasing. In this experiment, the rate of convergence is close to $1/2$
and the number of function evaluations is a linear function of the number 
of variables (approximately $30n$).
