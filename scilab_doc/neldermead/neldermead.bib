   abstract = {A method is described for the minimization of a function of n variables, which depends on the comparison of function values at the (n + 1) vertices of a general simplex, followed by the replacement of the vertex with the highest value by another point. The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems. 10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308},

     abstract = {A technique for empirical optimisation is presented in which a sequence of experimental designs each in the form of a regular or irregular simplex is used, each simplex having all vertices but one in common with the preceding simplex, and being completed by one new point. Reasons for the choice of design are outlined, and a formal procedure given. The performance of the technique in the presence and absence of error is studied and it is shown (a) that in the presence of error the rate of advance is inversely proportional to the error standard deviation, so that replication of observations is not beneficial, and (b) that the "efficiency" of the technique appears to increase in direct proportion to the number of factors investigated. It is also noted that, since the direction of movement from each simplex is dependent solely on the ranking of the observations, the technique may be used even in circumstances when a response cannot be quantitatively assessed. Attention is drawn to the ease with which second-order designs having the minimum number of experimental points may be derived from a regular simplex, and a fitting procedure which avoids a direct matrix inversion is suggested. In a brief appendix one or two new rotatable designs derivable from a simplex are noted.},

The inversion is shown to fail with increased dimensionality of the problem due to a pathology in the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm used. Robust simplex search variants are tested on the problem and shown to successfully address this pathology resulting in a significant increase in the dimensionality for which the problem can be solved.}
