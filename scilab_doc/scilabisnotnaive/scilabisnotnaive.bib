If $h$ is too large, truncation errors cause poor answers, while if $h$ is too small, cancellation and other "rounding" errors cause poor answers. We will show that by using simple results on the nature of the asymptotic convergence of $d(h)$ to $f'$, a reliable numerical method can be obtained which can yield efficiently the theoretical maximum number of accurate digits for the given machine precision.},

                 --- and discuss a few applications where such a library can be useful.",
