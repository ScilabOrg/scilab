\section{References}

A central reference on this subject is the article 
by Goldberg, "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic", 
\cite{WhatEveryComputerScientist}.
If one focuses on numerical algorithms, the "Numerical Recipes" \cite{NumericalRecipes},
is another good sources of solutions for that problem.
The work of Kahan is also central in this domain, for example \cite{Kahan2004}.
