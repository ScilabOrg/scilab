\title{Introduction to discrete probabilities with Scilab}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this article, we present an introduction to discrete probabilities with Scilab.
Numerical experiments are based on Scilab.
The first section present discrete random variables and 
conditionnal probabilities. In the second section, we present combinations problems,  
tree diagrams and Bernouilli trials. In the third section, we present simulation
of random processes with Scilab.
