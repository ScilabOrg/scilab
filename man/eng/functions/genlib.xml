  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>For each <VERB>.sci</VERB> file in <VERB>dir_name</VERB> (or only those
      specified by the <VERB>Names</VERB> argument), <VERB>genlib</VERB> executes a
    <VERB>getf</VERB> and saves the functions to the corresponding <VERB>.bin</VERB>
    file.  The <VERB>.sci</VERB> file must not contain anything but Scilab
    functions.  If a <VERB>.bin</VERB> file is newer than the associated
    <VERB>.sci</VERB> file, <VERB>genlib</VERB> does not translate and save the file.</P>
    
    <P>This default behaviour can be changed if <VERB>force</VERB> is given and 
    set to <VERB>%t</VERB>. In this latter case the recompilation is always 
    performed for each <VERB>.sci</VERB> file.</P>

    <P>When all <VERB>.sci</VERB> files have been processed, <VERB>genlib</VERB> creates a
    library variable named <VERB>lib_name</VERB> and saves it in the file
    <VERB>lib</VERB> in <VERB>dir_name</VERB>. If the Scilab variable
      <VERB>lib_name</VERB> is not protected (see <LINK>predef</LINK>) this
      variable is updated.</P>

    <P>If <VERB>verbose</VERB> is et to <VERB>%t</VERB> information are displayed during 
    the build process.</P>

    <P>If <VERB>dir_name</VERB> argument is not given and if <VERB>lib_name</VERB>
    Scilab variable  exists and it is a library dir_name is taken equal to the
    <VERB>lib_name</VERB> library path (update mode).</P>

  </DESCRIPTION>
  <SECTION label="Restrictions">
    <P>
    Scilab tacitly assumes that file <VERB>foo.sci</VERB> defines at least a
      function named <VERB>foo</VERB>. If subsidiary functions are included,
      they are made known to Scilab only after the function <VERB>foo</VERB>
      had been referenced.</P>
