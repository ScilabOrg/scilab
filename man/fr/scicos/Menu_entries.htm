File menu</A>
</font></H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>File:New</B>
<BR>
Clicking on the New menu item loads an empty diagram in the
       active editor Scicos window. If the previous content of the
       window is not saved, it will be lost.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Open</B>
<BR>
Select the Open menu item to load an ASCII or binary file
       containing a saved block diagram or palette.
       A dialog box allows user choosing the file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Rename</B>
<BR>
This menu allows to change the diagram name. An editable
        dialog box opens.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Save (s)</B>
<BR>
Select the save menu item to save the block diagram
       in a binary file already selected by a previous
       select the Save As menu item. If you select this
       menu item and you have never clicked on the Save As
       menu item, the diagram is saved in the current directory
       as "window_name".cos where "window_name" is the name
       of the window appearing on top of the window (usually
       Untitled or Super Block).

<P>
The .cos binary files are machine independent.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Save As</B>
<BR>
Select the Save As menu item to save the block diagram or
       palette in a file. A dialog box allows choosing the file
       which must have a .cos or .cosf extension. The diagram
       takes the name of the file (without the extension).

<P>
If extension is ".cosf" an ASCII  formatted save is performed
       instead of binary save. Formatted save is slower than regular 
       save.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Save as Interf Func</B>
<BR>
Select "the Save as Interf. Func." menu item to save the 
       diagram as a new Scicos block. A Scilab function is generated
       and saved in a file with ".sci" extension. File name and path
       are to be set in a "File menu" dialog.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Export</B>
<BR>
This menu is used to export a figure of the 
       current Scicos diagram. The export can be done
       directly in postscript format or done first in a
       graphic window to export in a second step in all
       the format that scilab can provide.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Export All</B>
<BR>
This menu is used to export Scicos diagrams in postscript format.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Exit Scicos</B>
<BR>
Click on the Exit Scicos menu item to close Scicos.
       That menu allows to return to Scilab session 
       even if the current diagram is a Super block.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>File:Quit (q)</B>
<BR>
Click on the Quit menu item to close current diagram. 
       If current diagram is not a Super block, Exit menu closes 
       Scicos and returns to Scilab session. Save your diagram 
       or/and your palette before leaving.

<P>
File/Close menu has the same effect.

</LI>
<LI><B>Diagram:Purge</B>
<BR>
Select the Purge menu item to get a clean data structure.
       If diagram has been hugely modified many deleted blocks
       may remain in the data structure. It may be  useful to
       suppress then before saving.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Diagram:Set Diagram Info</B>
<BR>
This menu allows to set user's diagram information.
       This info is stored in the diagram data structure
       and may be used for diagram documentation.

<P>
Information format may be redefined by user.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Diagram:Region to Super Block</B>
<BR>
This menu allows to transform a rectangular region of the
       current diagram by a super block.
       Click  on a corner of the region, drag an click left to
       fix the region (left click cancels selection).

<P>
Region is replaced by a super block and links are redrawn.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Diagram:Context</B>
<BR>
When you select this menu item you obtain a dialog to enter 
       Scilab instructions for defining symbolic Scicos parameters 
       used in block definitions or to do whatever you want.

<P>
These instructions will be evaluated each time the diagram 
       is loaded.

<P>
If you change the value of a symbolic Scicos parameters in 
       the context, all the blocks are updated (Eval is performed).

</LI>
<LI><B>Palette:Save as Palette</B>
<BR>
Select the Save as Palette menu item to save the block diagram
       as a palette in a file. A dialog box allows choosing 
       the file which must have a .cos or .cosf extension. The palette
       takes the name of the file (without the extension).

<P>
If extension is ".cosf" an ASCII  formatted save is performed
       instead of binary save. It may take a while.
